# RSiena 1.3.5

##

2021-12-15

## Changes in RSiena:  

### Bug corrections  
   * Corrected the check for effects in `initializeFRAN.r` which led to errors
     if interaction effects are included, because of the changes to
     `includeInteraction` in version 1.3.4.

# RSiena 1.3.4

##

2021-12-08

## Changes in RSiena:  

### Effects:
  * New effects `inRateInv`, `inRateLog` (Steffen Triebel).

### Improvements of functionality:  
   * When an effects object with interaction effects is printed,
     the names of the interacting effects are mentioned,
     and prefixes "int." and "i3." were dropped.
   * The check of whether an interaction effect is allowed now is done
     immediately when creating the interaction effect instead of waiting
     for its use in `siena07`. 
   * For function `sienaGroupCreate` some changes were made:   
     if it is applied to a list of length 1, attributes of the single group
     are not recomputed;   
     if it is applied to a list of length larger than 1, the attributes
     "range" and "range2" of behavioral variables of individual groups are
     computed as the range of the unions of the ranges of all the groups.
     The same is done for covariates.
   * `print.sienaGroup` slightly extended.
   * Creation of covariates gives a warning (optional) if all values 
     are missing, and also if all non-missing values are the same.

### Bug corrections  
   * if a `sienaGroup` object is given to `sienaBayes` and some of the 
     covariates are constant in one or more of the groups, the ``simX` effect 
     will not run into an error any more; this is achieved by the first change
     mentioned above for `sienaGroupCreate`.
   * `sienaFitThetaTable` in `sienaprint.r` was corrected for `from sienaBayes`.
   * `siena.table` was corrected for `sienaBayes` objects, and this possibility
     was mentioned in the help file.

### Coding changes:
   * In `sienaprint.r`, methods and functions relating to `sienaBayes` omitted.

### Tests:   
   * Test 18, a test for ``sienaGroupCreate`, added to `parallel.R`.
     

# RSiena 1.3.3
   
## 
   
2021-10-09

## Changes in RSiena:  

### Effects:
   * internal effect parameter for diffusion rate effects ('at least p').
   * New effect `outOutAvIntn`.
   * `outOutActIntn` also made available for non-directed explanatory networks 
     and for two-mode dependent networks.

### Improvements of functionality: 
   * `toggleProbabilities` added to output of `sienaRI`.
   * Trial values of `theta` used during Phase 2 of `siena07` added 
     to the `sienaFit` object `ans` as `ans$thetas`.
   * warnings if a data object contains only missings, or only the same value.

### Bug corrections  
   * if a data set contains a constant covariate, the simX effect will
     not run into an error any more; this is obtained by defining the `range` 
     attribute of the covariate as 1 to prevent division by zero,
     and the `simMean` attribute as 0 instead of `NaN` (`sienaDataCreate`). 
     This is relevant especially for `sienaGroup` data sets, where covariates 
     might be constant for some of the groups.`

### Corrections of documentation: 
   * In `sienaAlgorithmCreate`, the default values of `diagonalize` for MoM
     is 0.2; this was corrected in the help file.
     

# RSiena 1.3.2
   
## 
   
2021-07-29

## Changes in RSiena:  

### Improvements of functionality: 
   * Effects of type `creation` or `endow` represented in siena.table
     by `creation` and `maintenance`, respectively.    
     This was erroneously omitted in 1.3.1.

# RSiena 1.3.1
   
## 
   
2021-07-27

### Effects:
   * New effects: `crprodInActIntn` (Nynke Niezink), `XXW`.

### Improvements of functionality: 
   * Effects of type `creation` or `endow` represented in siena.table
     by `creation` and `maintenance`, respectively.
   * `updateTheta` also accepts `sienaBayesFit` objects as `prevAns`.

## Small corrections:    
   * If `upOnly` or `downOnly`, the (out)degree (density) effect is also 
     excluded for symmetric networks 
     (this was reported in `print01Report`, but not carried out).
     This happens in `effects.r`.
   * Message corrected in `sienaDataCreate` if there is an attribute `higher`.
   
   
# RSiena 1.3.0
      
##

   * Drop `testthat` in tests.   

# RSiena 1.2.34
   
## 
   
2021-04-30  
   
### New functions:
   * `testSame.RSiena`.
   
### Effects:  
   * New effects: `avInSim` (thanks to Steffen Triebel), `totInSim`, 
     `avInSimPopAlt`, `totInSimPopAlt`, `constant`,
     `avAttHigher`, `avAttLower`, `totAttHigher`, `totAttLower`.
   * Changed effects: endowment and creation types for `avInSim`
     (brought in line with these types for `avSim`).
    
### Improvements of functionality:  
   * `funnelPlot` adapted to lists of `sienaFit` objects
     containing missing estimates or standard errors.
   * `plot.sienaGOF`: new parameter `position`.
   * Small improvements (length of effect names) in `meta.table` and 
    `siena.table`.  
   
### Bug corrections  
   * Restore backward compatibility with respect to checks of `x$gmm`.  
   * In test functions: correct names reported for tested effects by 
     using `ans$requestedEffects` instead of `ans$effects`.
   
### Code improvements   
   * Improved coding of `SimilarityEffect`, using new parts
     of `NetworkDependentBehaviorEffect`.   
   * Changed unsigned actors to int in `Continuousvariable` and 
     `EpochSimulation`;   
     int ...EffectCounts to unsigned in `BehaviorVariable`, 
     to avoid warnings in C++ compilation.
   * Changed name of `similarity(int i, int j)` to `actor_similarity`
     in order to avoid confusion with `similarity(double v1, double v2)`.
   
### Corrections  
   * Took out of `NAMESPACE` a few imported functions from `graphics`, 
     `stats`, `utils` that were not used.  
   * Correction of footer of `CovariateDistance2EgoAltSimNetworkFunction.h`.
  
# RSiena 1.2.33

## 

2021-03-19  


   * Adjusted `configure`, `cleanup` and `Makevars` files for just C++ checks.
   * Pandoc dropped as a system requirement.
 
# RSiena 1.2.32

## 

2021-03-16

### Effects:
   * New effects: `homXTransRecTrip`, `toU`.
   * This implied creation of a new effect class `dyadANetNetObjective`.
   * sqrt versions for parameter 2 for the effects `to`, `toBack`, `toRecip`,
     `from`, `fromMutual`.
   * Effects `to`, `toU`, `toBack`, `toRecip`, `MixedInXW` are dyadic.
   * Reinstated effect `MixedInXW`, also with sqrt version for parameter 2.
   * Dropped effect `to.2` (identical to `to`) 
     and `MixedInWX` (identical to `toBack`).

### Improvements of functionality:
   * `effectsDocumentation` now also includes `gmm` effects (at the bottom).
   * Improved `fromObjectToLaTeX` in `meta.table` and `siena.table`.
   * Display of deviations from targets changed to after subtraction of targets.
   * Stop if no parameters are estimated and `simOnly` is FALSE (initializeFRAN).

### Reduction of functionality:
   * Vignette `basicRSiena.Rmd` dropped (available at website).

### Documentation:
   * Extended description of GMoM in the manual.
   * Description of `toBack` and `toRecip` in manual.
   * Changed keyword for some help pages.

### Corrections / safeguards
   * Correction in phase3.2 of a bug that sometimes led to an error message 
     if `simOnly`.
   * `oneModeNet` in `effects.r`: some further cases where the comparison of
     types with `behavior` is replaced by 
     comparison with c(`behavior`, `continuous`).
   * Extra check in `phase1.2`.
   * Temporarily drop the final part of `test16`,
     in view of an irreproducible error.

### More neat code:
   * Dropped `MixedOutStarFunction`, `MixedInStarFunction`, 
     `MixedTwoPathFunction`, 
     (their functionality replaced by `MixedTwoStepFunction`).
   * Dropped `MixedTwoStepFunction` from effects 
     (its place is in `effects\generic`, and that's were it is).


# RSiena 1.2-31

2021-02-27

   * Generalized method of Moments implemented (Viviana Amati):
     see docs\manual\Changes\_RSiena\_GMoM.tex;
     new function `includeGMoMStatistics`, extended functionality of `siena07`.
   * Require R >= 3.5.0.
   * `xtable` added to `Imports` (used to be in `Suggests`).
   * `dyadicCov` made to accept also changing dyadic covariates.
   * Used `verbose` condition in `sienaGOF` also for last console output.
   * new arguments `plotAboveThreshold` and `verbose` for `funnelPlot`.

# RSiena 1.2.30

## 

2021-02-23

   * Resolved issue with continuous dependent behavior variables 
     (Nynke Niezink).

# RSiena 1.2-29

## 

2020-12-10

   * New effects (due to Christoph Stadtfeld):
     `transtrip.FR`, `transtrip.FE`, `transtrip.EE`, `WWX.EE`, `WWX.FR`, 
     `WXX.FE`, `WXX.ER`, `XWX.ER`, `XWX.FE`, `to.2`, `toBack`, `toRecip`.
   * New effect `transtripX`.
   * New functions `meta.table` and `funnelPlot`.
   * For effect `from.w.ind`, option parameter=-1 added.
   * The `to` effect is an ego effect.
   * New parameter `tested` in sienaGOF.
   * For `siena.table`, some of the effectNames changed to nice strings,
     so that `LaTeX` can run without errors if `type=tex`.
   * The object produced by `siena08` now has IWLS estimates more easily 
     accessible, as `object$muhat` and `object$se.muhat`.
   * Error message in `sienaTimeTest` for `sienaFit` objects produced with
     `lessMem=TRUE`.
   * More extensive error message for error in named vectors in algorithm object
     (`checkNames` in `initializeFRAN`).
   * For `sienaDataCreate`: more extensive error message, and `class(...)` 
     replaced by `class(...)[1]`. 
   * multiplication factor added to `print.sienaAlgorithm` if `maxlike`.
   * In `sienaAlgorithmCreate`: requirements for `mult` corrected in help page.
   * In `sienaAlgorithmCreate`, use the definitions for projname=NULL
     also if any environment variable _R_CHECK* is set.

   * Adapted filter `disjoint` so that it operates correctly
     also when the network is symmetric.
     Consequence: constraint that two networks are disjoint
     operates correctly also when one of the networks is symmetric
     and the other is not.
   * Adapted filter `higher` so that it operates correctly
     also when the other network is symmetric.
     Consequence: constraint that one network is at least as high
     as another network operates correctly also when 
     the higher networks is symmetric and the other is not.
   * In `CheckConstraints`, used in `sienaDataCreate`, the requirement 
     was dropped that the two networks have the same symmetry property;
     and for `higher` it is required that if the lower network
     is symmetric, the higher network is also symmetric.
   * In `sienaDataConstraint`, if type is `disjoint` or `atLeastOne`,
     the constraint is also implemented for the pair (net2, net1).
   * Vignette `basicRSiena` added (was earlier available as a script);
     thanks to James Hollway.

# RSiena 1.2-26

2020-09-17 

   * Changed requirement for `tcltk` to `Suggests`, 
     and further modified / cleaned up DESCRIPTION.
   * In siena07: if `(!requireNamespace(tcltk))` set batch to TRUE.
   * In NAMESPACE drop `tcltk`.
   * In `sienaAlgorithmCreate`, use the definitions for projname=NULL
     also if any environment variable _R_CHECK* is set.
