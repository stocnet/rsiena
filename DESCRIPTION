Description: The main purpose of this package is to perform simulation-based 
   estimation of stochastic actor-oriented models for longitudinal network 
   data collected as panel data. Dependent variables can be single or 
   multivariate networks, which can be directed, non-directed, or two-mode;
   and associated actor variables. 
   There are also functions for testing parameters and checking goodness of fit.
   An overview of these models is given in Tom A.B. Snijders (2017), Stochastic 
   Actor-Oriented Models for Network Dynamics, Annual Review of Statistics and 
   Its Application, 4, 343-363 <doi: 10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-054035>.
   An extensive manual, scripts, and much further information is at the Siena 
   website <http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena>.
