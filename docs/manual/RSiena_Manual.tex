\section{General information}


\si
\footnote{This program was first presented at the
International Conference for Computer Simulation and the Social
Sciences, Cortona (Italy), September 1997, which originally was
scheduled to be held in Siena. See \citet{SnijdersDuijn97}.},
shorthand for {\sf Simulation Investigation for Empirical
Network Analysis}, is a set of methods
implemented in a computer program that carries out the
statistical estimation of models for repeated measures of social
networks according to the Stochastic Actor-oriented Model
 (`SAOM') of \citet{SnijdersDuijn97}, \citet{Snijders01},
\citet{SnijdersEA07},  \citet{SnijdersEA10a}, \citet{SLT2013},
\citet{Greenan15}, and \citet{KoskinenSnijders2023};
also see \citet{SteglichEA10}.
A tutorial for these models is in \citet{SnijdersEA10b}.
A review article is \citet{Snijders2017}.
Books are in preparation \citep{AMAND,SNDE}.

A website for \SI is maintained at
{\small\url{https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/}~}.
At this website (`publications' tab)
you shall also find references to introductions in various other languages,
as well as the file
\href{https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}
 which
gives a sketch of the main algorithms used in \rs.
The website further contains references to many published examples,
example scripts illustrating various possibilities of the package,
course announcements, etc.

\RS is a contributed package for the \R statistical system \citep{R}
and can be installed in the usual way from \sfn{CRAN};
see \url{http://cran.r-project.org}.
Development versions of \RS are at
\url{https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena/}.
Here also the most recent version is available
at \url{https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena/releases};
it is recommended to use this version.

This is a manual for \rs;
the manual is provisional in the sense
that it is continually being updated, taking account of
updates in the package. For the operation of \Rn,
the reader is referred to this manual, the help pages,
the website, and the corresponding literature.

For working with \rs, please use jointly the following

\section{Getting started with \SI}
\label{S_minsi1}

There may be various strategies for getting acquainted with \rs.
In any case, it is a good idea to study the tutorial  \citet{SnijdersEA10b}.
Two recommended options for learning the `how to' are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item One excellent option is to read the User's Manual
from start to finish (leaving aside the Programmer's Manual).
\item A second option is to read this Minimal Introduction, to get a sense
 of the rest by looking at the table of contents, and then follow
			the references to specific sections of your interest.
  The searchable pdf file makes it easy to look for the relevant words.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
This Minimal Introduction explains the basics of {\saom}s
and gives practical information on running \rs.
We start with section \ref{S_logic} which gives a brief and non-technical
introduction to the types of {\saom}s, to the most important concepts related
to them, to the data required to apply \si, and to further features of the program.
In Section~\ref{S_use} we explain how to install and run \SI
as the package \RS from within \Rn. Section~\ref{R_scripts} and
Section~\ref{S_exec} provide example \R scripts and guidance for
understanding the results.
If you are looking for help with a specific problem, read
Section~\ref{sec:problems}.


\subsection{The logic of {\saom}s}
\label{S_logic}

\SI (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis) is a
statistical tool developed for the analysis of longitudinal network data,
collected in a network panel study with two or more `waves' of observations.
It incorporates different variants of a dynamic network model family:
the \SAOM (SAOM). In this section, we give
a very concise introduction to how these models work in principle and what
type of data they are suitable to analyze. For sake of simplicity,
SAOMs implemented in \SI are often referred to as `\SI models'.
In this subsection, we only consider the case of network evolution;
see below for the more complex cases of coevolution.
For a further introduction, consult  \citet{SnijdersEA10b}.
An introduction for applications in the context of adolescent
development is \citet{VeenstraEtAl2013}.

The defining characteristic of {\saom}s
is their `actor-oriented' nature which means that they model
change from the perspective of the actors (nodes).
That is, {\saom}s always ``imagine" network evolution
as individual actors creating, maintaining or terminating ties to other actors.
When thinking about network dynamics, researchers usually assume that these
decisions (conscious or subconscious) of actors are influenced by the structure
of the network itself and the characteristics and behaviors of the focal actor
(ego) who is making a decision and those of other actors in the network (alters).
{\saom}s provide a means to quantify the ways, the
extent and the uncertainty with which these factors are associated with
network evolution between observations.

The \SAOM can be regarded as an agent-based (`actor-based') simulation
model of the network evolution; where all network changes are decomposed into
very small steps, so-called \emph{ministeps}, in which
one actor creates or terminates one outgoing tie.
These ministeps are probabilistic and made sequentially.
The transition from the observation
at one wave to the next is done by means of normally a large number of ministeps.
The actors respond to the network in the sense that the probabilities
of these changes depend on the current (unobserved) state of the network.
Each further ministep changes the network state and therefore the actors
are each others' ever changing context  \citep{Zeg94}.
This allows the model to represent the feedback process
that is typical for network dynamics. These changes are not
individually observed, but they are simulated;
what is observed is the state obtained at the next observation wave.

This simulation model implements the statistical model
for the network dynamics. The statistical procedures utilize
a large number of repeated simulations of the network evolution
from each wave to the next. They estimate and test the parameters
producing a probabilistic network evolution
that `could have' brought these observations to follow one another.

To avoid misunderstandings, two notes have to be made about the
meaning of actor ``decisions" and the role of {\saom}s in causal inference.
First, the fact that \SI models are actor-oriented does not imply the assumption
that the actors take
decisions in any real sense. It means that the changes in the network are
organized, so to say, by the nodes in the network. This aligns very well
with a substantive standpoint where the nodes have agency \citep{Snijders96}
but it does not necessarily reflect a commitment to or belief in any particular
theory of action elaborated in
the scientific disciplines. In fact, the purpose of \SI in this matter is
to assist substantive researchers in further developing their theories
of action by e.g.\ exploring the relative importance of individual,
contextual, and social factors in network change. The second, and related,
point is that, like other generalized regression models, \SI does not
by itself solve all causal questions. When inferring causality from model
results, one has to face difficulties very similar to those with other
statistical methods; see, e.g., \citet{LSST11} and \citet{Goldthorpe2001}.
In any case, causal interpretations should be supported by further results
from the discipline the explanations originate in.
However, {\saom}s do allow research to profit from a longitudinal
design -- therefore, they may be helpful in tackling some issues related
to causality, like the selection-influence problem \citep{SteglichEA10, LSST11}.

\subsubsection[Types of {\saom}s]
     {Types of {\saom}s: \protect\newline
     evolution of one-mode networks, two-mode networks and behaviors}
\label{S_types}

So far, we have mostly talked about \SI as a tool to analyze the evolution
of a single network. However, there are different variants of {\saom}s that
can be applied to more complex data structures.
The availability of these options depends on the research question and the
quantity and type of data one has. In this section, we briefly discuss the
currently implemented model types, which will help researchers determine what
kind of analyses they are able to carry out with {\saom}s
given the data at hand.

A minimal dataset suitable for analysis with \RS consists of two observations of
a single network defined on the same set of nodes. In this case, one is able to
test how the structure of the network contributes to its own evolution.
However, depending on the data available, further modeling options may be
applicable. Currently, the implemented {\saom}s
are suitable for the analysis of
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	the evolution of a directed or non-directed one-mode network
        (e.g., friendships in a classroom) \citep{Snijders01};
	\item	the evolution of a two-mode network
        (e.g., club memberships in a classroom: the first mode
        is constituted by the students, the second mode by the clubs)
        \citep{KoskinenEdling2012};
	\item	the evolution of an individual behavior (e.g., smoking), and
	\item	the co-evolution of one-mode networks, two-mode networks and
        individual behaviors (e.g., the joint evolution friendship and smoking;
        or of friendship and club membership) \citep{SteglichEA10, SLT2013}.
\end{enumerate}
In all these cases, the data can also include covariates: observed variables
that influence the dynamics, but of which the values are not themselves
modeled.

In the first two cases, one can assess with \RS the ways and the extent
to which changes in a given one- or two-mode network depend on the network
structure itself and on covariates. The third option, modeling changes in
an individual behavior on its own, without reference to its embeddedness
in a network, is rarely used.
For this type of data numerous alternative longitudinal modeling techniques
exist.

Accordingly, the fourth model type has been becoming widely used.
Analyzing the joint evolution of networks and behavior allows researchers
to address questions related to selection and influence processes, for
example, whether smokers tend to become friends with each other or friends
 tend to become similar in their smoking habits. The strength of the \SI
co-evolution models is that one can simultaneously take into account
the impact of network structure on network evolution, the actual level
of a behavior on behavior change, the network structure on behavior change,
and the actual level of behavior on network evolution. Besides network and
behavior co-evolution, this class of {\saom}s
also allow for the joint analysis of multiple networks (e.g. friendship
and advice, friendship and dislike, or all three of them), and the
analysis of ordered multiple networks (where the presence of a tie
in one network presumes the existence of a tie in the other network,
like in the case of friendships and best friend relations).


\subsubsection{Data, variables and effects}
\label{S_datvareff}

Now that we have discussed some core features of {\saom}s and introduced
the different implemented model types,
we turn our attention, still just presenting an outline, to
data types and the specification of a model. In general, the
number of waves must be at least two in order to analyze a
data set with {\saom}s. In case of modeling
 evolution across more than two observations in time, estimated
parameter values are assumed to be equal in all periods (unless time
heterogeneity is specifically represented by changing parameters --
see Section~\ref{S_timetest1} for further details).

This section focuses on three related topics: the type of network and
behavioral data \SI works with, the meaning of explanatory variables,
or so called effects, in {\saom}s, and the
different dependent variables with which \SI captures network and
behavior evolution.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Network data}\\

{\saom}s operate on binary networks,
that is, on relations on a given set of actors,
where tie variables between actors have two states:
existent (1) or non-existent (0).
Weighted networks are not allowed, but as mentioned above, it is
possible to define multiple networks representing discrete levels
of relationships. It is possible to specify that some ties in the
network are impossible (``structural zeros") or necessary (``structural ones")
(see Section~\ref{S_struct} for more details).
For the network evolution, {\saom}s how ties
are being created, maintained or terminated by actors.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Behavioral data}\\

Behavioral variables in {\saom}s can be
thought of as indicating the presence or intensity of a behavior.
For example, behavioral data can represent whether an actor is a
smoker or not, as well as a number of ordered categories
expressing the number of cigarettes usually smoked.
The term ``behavior" should not be taken literally here, it is
possible to model changes in attitudes or other actor attributes.
In the models, behavioral variables can be binary, ordinal discrete,
or continuous. For the ordinal discrete case, the number of categories should be small
(mostly 2 to 5; larger ranges are possible).
In the case of behaviors, {\saom}s express
how actors increase, decrease, or maintain the level of their behavior.\\

A special case of the fourth type is the
\emph{diffusion of innovations in dynamic networks}
\citep{Greenan15}:
here the behavior variable representing
having adopted the innovation is binary, coded 0 or 1, and
once an actor has the value 1 s/he is stuck with it.
The only possible transitions are $0 \Rightarrow 1$, representing
that the actor adopts the innovation.
See Section~\ref{S_behRate}.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Covariates}\\

In every model type, it is possible to define and use covariates,
which are variables that are exogenous in the sense that
their values are not modeled, but used to explain network or behavior
change. Covariates can be dummy variables (e.g., sex)
or continuous (e.g., attitudes or age).
Also, they may have constant values across all observations or their
value may change across time periods -- this is the
distinction between constant and varying covariates
(e.g., sex and salary). Finally, there are
individual (monadic) and dyadic covariates that refer, respectively, to
characteristics of individual actors (e.g., sex) and to attributes
of pairs of actors (e.g., living in the same neighborhood or kinship).\\

\noindent
\textbf{Missing data and composition change}\\

{\saom}s distinguish between two types
of missing values: absence of actors from the network and
random missingness. The first case refers to changing composition:
it is possible to specify that some actors leave or join the
network between two observations (during the simulation process).
This then applies to all dependent variables (networks, behaviors)
simultaneously (see Section~\ref{S_comp} for more details).
In the second case, missing values are treated as randomly missing
(see Section~\ref{S_missing} for more details).
{\saom}s can deal with some, but not too much,
randomly missing data (as a rule of thumb, more than 20\% is
considered to be too much). With too many missing values,
the simulation can become unstable, and also the estimated
parameters may not be substantively reliable anymore.
And of course, missing data are likely to are caused by
processes that are not totally random, and therefore risk
to bias the resuls.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Explanatory variables: the effects}\\

When defining {\saom}s, we have to specify
the exact ways in which current network structure or covariates may affect
network or behavior change. This is defined
by combinations of configurations (or situations) which
are called ``effects" in {\saom}s.
Effects can be treated as the explanatory variables of the models.
Effects can be structural (depending on the network structure itself,
also called endogenous), or covariate-related; also various combinations
between structure and covariates are possible. Some examples for effects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{structural effects:} reciprocity, transitivity;
	\item \emph{covariate effects:} sex of the tie sender, sex of the receiver,
                same sex, similarity in salary;
	\item \emph{combinations:} average level of smoking of friends,
                interaction between sex of the sender and reciprocity.\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Dependent variables: network evaluation, creation and endowment functions}\\
\label{S_endow}

As we discussed earlier, \RS is capable of analyzing and modeling the
evolution of networks and behavior, jointly or separately.
Consequently, a model may have more than one dependent variable.
Here we introduce the ways network and behavior dependent variables
can be defined in {\saom}s. We start with network evolution.

\def\Fspace{\space\space\space\space}
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Possible tie change patterns for two observations ($t_1$ and $t_2$)}
	\label{tab:TCpat}
	\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\begin{tabular}{c | c | l}
		$t_{1}$ 				& $t_{2}$ 				&														\\ \hline
		$i$ \Fspace $j$ & $i  \to 		 j$	& creation of a tie 				\\
		$i  \to			 j$	& $i  \to 		 j$	& maintenance of a tie 			\\
		$i  \to			 j$	& $i$ \Fspace $j$ & termination of a tie 			\\
		$i$ \Fspace $j$	& $i$ \Fspace $j$ & maintenance of a `no-tie' \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Given two observations of a binary network, a single network tie variable
can follow four patterns, as shown in Table \ref{tab:TCpat}.
In {\saom}s, however, tie change can be
defined in three ways: we can model the creation of previously not
existing ties (creation), the maintenance of existing ties (endowment),
or the presence of ties regardless of whether they were newly created
or maintained (evaluation). These are the three possible values of the
change in tie variables, constituting the dependent
variables of the network evolution model.
The effects model the probabilities
(more precisely: they are components of the linear
predictor for the log-probability)
for the creation, maintenance or
presence of network ties. Table~\ref{tab:TCece} helps to imagine
what the probabilities refer to in each case: we compare the probability of
green cases to that of blue cases.

\end{table}

According to this distinction, network evolution may be modeled
in \RS by three functions: the evaluation, creation and endowment functions.
Effects can appear as components of one or two of these functions in a single model,
but never in all three (this would lead to perfect collinearity).
Using only the evaluation effect assumes that the creation and endowment
effects are equal (and equal to the evaluation effect). The estimated
parameters for each effect should be interpreted as log-probability ratios
(comparable to the log-odds ratios known from logistic regression;
since the choice here is multinomial rather than binary, the correct term
is probability ratios rather than odds ratios).
From a practical point of view, it is meaningful to start modeling with
evaluation effects, unless one has a clear idea about how tie creation
and endowment may be different in the analyzed data set.
Separating the contribution of an effect into two functions requires
more of the data, and if a given effect is similarly strong for the
creation and maintenance of ties the statistical power will
decrease by this split.
For these reasons, most  \
SI studies limit their
attention to evaluation effects. However, if there is enough data,
the distinction between creation and maintenance of ties can
produce powerful insights \citep[e.g.,][]{Cheadle_etal2013}.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Dependent variables: behavior evaluation, creation and endowment functions}\\

The distinction between the different behavior evolution functions follows
a logic similar to the case of network evolution. The three possibilities
for change in behavior are increasing or decreasing the level of behavior
by one unit, or maintaining its actual level. In case of the evaluation
function, the model does not distinguish between upward and downward changes,
only looks at the resulting level of behavior. By using the creation and
endowment functions, we can obtain separate parameters (and assess the
different impact) of effects for the increase and the decrease of behavior.

\subsubsection{Outline of estimation procedure}
\label{S_estim}
\noindent
\RS estimates parameters by the function \sfn{siena07}
and (alternatively) \sfn{sienacpp}, using the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Certain statistics are used that reflect the parameter values;\\
  the finally obtained parameters should be such that the \emph{expected
    values}
  of the statistics are equal to the \emph{observed values}.\\
  Expected values are approximated as the averages over a lot of simulated
  networks.\\
  Observed values are calculated from the data set. These are also called the
  \emph{target values}.
\item To find these parameter values, an \emph{iterative stochastic simulation
    algorithm}
  is applied.
  This works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In Phase~1, the sensitivity of the statistics to the parameters is roughly
  determined.
\item In Phase~2, provisional parameter values are updated iteratively:\\
  this is done by simulating a network according to the provisional parameter
  values, calculating the statistics and the deviations between these simulated
  statistics and the \emph{target values}, and making a little change (the
  `update') in the parameter values
  that hopefully goes into the right direction. A lot of such updating steps
  are taken, each using the parameter that was produced in the preceding step.\\
  (Only a `hopefully' good update is possible, because the simulated network is
  only a random draw from the distribution of networks, and not the expected
  value itself.)
\item In Phase~3, the final result of Phase~2 is used, and it is checked if the
  average statistics of many simulated networks are indeed close to the target
  values. This is reflected in the so-called
  \texttt{overall maximum convergence ratio} and the \texttt{t statistics for deviations
  from targets}. If some of these are too high (a threshold of 0.25 is used for the
  overall maximum convergence ratio, and a threshold of 0.1 for the absolute value
  of the t statistics for deviations from targets), the estimation must be repeated.
   Standard errors for the parameters are also estimated in this
  phase.

  If the estimation has to be repeated, this can be done by employing the
  argument \texttt{prevAns} in the call of \sfn{siena07}
  (or \sfn{sienacpp}).
  See the help page for  \sfn{siena07}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Design issues for longitudinal network modeling}

Issues concerning the design of longitudinal network models
according to the \SAOM are discussed in
\citet{StadfeldSnijdersSteglichVanDuijn2018}.

\subsubsection{Identifiability}

Identifiability of a statistical model means that different
parameter vectors imply different probability distributions.
This is a basic requirement for any statistical model.

The \SAOM is so complicated mathematically that it is hard to give
proofs of any properties.
For this type of model, which comes to terms with strongly dependent
random variables, mathematical proofs of desirable properties
are so hard that they should not be prerequisites for the use of the model.
Identifiability depends, of course, on the model specification.
The \SAOM is a combination of generalized linear models
(one for the timing and another one for the choices of tie or behavior changes)
with very much missing data (the ministeps);
the basis in generalized linear models suggests
that -- unless there are redundant effects, e.g.,
effects of covariates that are constant across actors and across
waves -- the model is identifiable indeed.
The estimation algorithm is such that the fact that there is convergence
(see Section~\ref{S_ccheck}) strongly suggests that there is identifiability.


\subsubsection{Further useful options in \RS}
\label{S_etc}
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Checking for time heterogeneity (Sections~\ref{S_timetest1}
            and \ref{S_timetest2})
	\item	Goodness of fit (Section~\ref{S_gof})
	\item	Meta-analysis of \RS results (Section~\ref{S_Siena08})
	\item	Simulation without estimation (Section~\ref{S_sim})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installing \R and \RS }
\label{S_use}
\noindent
This and the next section give an overview of steps one needs to go through from
installing \R to running models in \rs.
Installing needs to be done only once (but should be repeated when next versions
of the software appear).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Install \Rn.\\
            This can be done from \url{http://cran.r-project.org/} .\\
            Many users prefer some kind of additional environment, such as \texttt{RStudio}, or
            the combination of \texttt{Notepad++} with \texttt{NppToR}.\\
            For Mac, you may also need \sfn{X11}, which is
            used for \sfn{tcltk}; but this is not a necessity. See the FAQ list for R on Mac.
	\item	Install the package \rs, with dependencies.
            The other packages used are  \sfn{parallel}
            and \sfn{tools} (all included in the basic \R distribution);
            \sfn{Matrix}, \sfn{MASS}, \sfn{lattice}, \sfn{codetools}
            (`recommended' packages included in most R distributions),
            \sfn{network} and \sfn{xtable}. \sfn{tcltk} is optional.
            For goodness of fit testing it will be useful also to
            install \sfn{sna} and \sfn{igraph}.
%            For constructing the vignette in \RS the
%            packages \sfn{knitr} and \sfn{rmarkdown} are used.

\iffalse
            You can just install \RS and the other packages
            in the regular way from CRAN.
            If you want to have detailed information about
            what is available at CRAN, go to\\
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSiena/} .\\
            However, it is advisable to have 
\fi
            Currently (mid February 2024), \RS is archived on CRAN,
            which means that it is not directly available.
            This hopefully will be restored soon.
            
            You can download
            the latest version of \RS
            from GitHub or the \SI website.
            To do this, go to\\
            \url{https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena/releases}\\
            or to\\
              \url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/siena_downloads.htm}\\
            and there download the appropriate version of the package
            appropriate for your operation system (Windows, Mac, Unix). 
            
\iffalse
            Installation can be done in various ways --- by the function \texttt{install.packages()}
            in \Rn,
            via the drop-down menu in the \R console, or in command mode which for Mac is
            the `terminal'.
            If you downloaded a binary file (\texttt{.zip} for Windows,
            \texttt{.tgz} for Mac),
            then using the binary is recommended.
            Installation from binary is much faster than installation from source.
\fi

            Installation from GitHub can be done as follows.
        Download  the latest release from
        \url{https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena/releases/}.
Once the file has been downloaded, unzip it, and install the binary
as appropriate for your Operating System.
This can be done in Windows using the dropdown menu under \texttt{Packages},
and for all Operating Systems using function \sfn{install.packages}
with \texttt{repos = NULL}.\\
In \sfn{RStudio}, go to \texttt{Tools  $\rightarrow$ Install packages}
and choose\\ \texttt{Install From: Package archive file (zip; tar.gz)}.

Alternatively, install the \texttt{remotes} package in R, 
and run
\begin{verbatim}  
remotes::install_github("stocnet/rsiena", build=FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Using \RS within \Rn}

   \begin{enumerate}
	\item	Load data (networks, behavior, covariates) into \R
            (see Section~\ref{S_datatypes}):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Network data should be in objects of class matrix or
            sparse matrix\\ (\texttt{"TsparseMatrix-class"}, package \sf{Matrix}).
		\item	Behavioral data should be in objects of class matrix;
		\item	Individual constant covariates should be in objects of
            class vector or should be in columns or rows of a matrix;
		\item	Individual varying covariates should be in objects of class matrix;
		\item	Dyadic covariates should be in objects of class matrix
               or \texttt{"TsparseMatrix-class"}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item	All missing data should be set to \texttt{NA} (see Section~\ref{S_missing}).
	\item Check whether your data objects meet the following criteria:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	Each object contains the same nodes/actors;
		\item	Nodes are in the same order in each object;
		\item	Nodes are in the same order in rows and columns of matrix
                objects (in case of one-mode networks)\footnote{For
		directions on how to handle composition change, see Section~\ref{S_comp}}.
	\end{enumerate}
   If a two-mode network is studied, then of course there will
   be two node sets.
	\item	Create data objects suitable for \RS using the appropriate
                functions (see Section~\ref{S_datatypes}):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	\sfn{sienaDependent} for networks and behavior variables;
		\item	only for two-mode networks, \sfn{sienaNodeSet} for defining nodesets;
		\item	\sfn{coCovar} and \sfn{varCovar} for constant and
                changing/varying individual covariates respectively;
		\item	\sfn{coDyadCovar} and \sfn{varDyadCovar} for
                constant and changing/varying dyadic covariates respectively;
		\item	In case of two-mode networks, for each object it should
                be specified which nodeset it is defined on, using the
                \sfn{nodeSets} argument in the above functions.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item	Create a \textsf{siena} data object containing all the objects
            specified above using the function \sfn{sienaDataCreate}
            (see Section~\ref{S_datatypes}).
	\item	Use \sfn{getEffects} to create an effects object.
            This already gives a very simple model specification
            containing the outdegree and a reciprocity effects
            (see Section~\ref{S_imp_str1} - for two-mode networks see
            Section~\ref{S_imp_str2}).
	\item	Use \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} to create an algorithm object
                (see Section~\ref{S_modspec}).
	\item	Use \sfn{print01Report} to produce an output file
                 presenting some descriptive statistics
                for the objects included in the model.
	\item	Use functions \sfn{includeEffects}, \sfn{setEffect} and
            \sfn{includeInteraction} to further specify the model
            (see Sections~\ref{S_imp_str1}~--~\ref{S_eff_beh}).
	\item	Use \sfn{siena07} or \sfn{sienacpp}
            to run the estimation procedure.\footnote{The
            use of multiple processes can speed up the estimation.
            For directions on how to utilize multiple processors,
            see Section~\ref{S_multipleProcesses}.}
	\item	Basic output is written to a log file in the actual working directory.
             The filename is the project name specified in the
             \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} function. Results can also be
             inspected in \R using various functions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example \R scripts for getting started}
\label{R_scripts}
The following scripts on the \RS website go through the steps
outlined in the previous section, providing additional details and options: \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \sfn{basicRSiena.r}: a minimal example of a basic sequence of commands
           for estimating a model by function \sfn{siena07} of \rs.
	\item \sfn{Rscript01DataFormat.R}: gives a brief overview of \R functions
            and data formats that are essential for using \rs.
	\item \sfn{Rscript02SienaVariableFormat.R}: shows how to prepare data
            for a \RS analysis, including the creation of \RS objects;
            and how to specify effects for \RS models.
	\item \sfn{Rscript03SienaRunModel.R}:
           shows how to carry out the estimation and look at the results;
	\item \sfn{Rscript04SienaBehaviour.R}: illustrates
      how to specify models for dynamics of networks and behaviour.
\end{itemize}
The website contains a lot of other scripts illustrating other functionalities
of \rs.


\subsection{Steps for looking at results: Executing \si .}
\label{S_exec}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Look at the start of the output file obtained from
       \sfn{print01Report} for general data
      description (degrees, etc.), to check your data input
      and get a general overview of the data set.

      In this file, there is a section `Change in networks' which contains
      some basic descriptives. Some of these refer to the \emph{periods}:
      these are the combinations of two successive waves.
      For example, a two-wave data set has one period, and a
      three-wave data sets has periods $1 \Rightarrow 2$ and $2 \Rightarrow 3$.
      The \texttt{Distance} mentioned there
      is the Hamming distance between successively observed networks, i.e.,
      the number of tie variables that differ.
      The \texttt{Jaccard} index is the Jaccard similarity index between the
  \index{Jaccard index}
      successive networks:
      \[
         \frac{N_{11}}{N_{01}+N_{10}+N_{11}} \ ,
      \]
      where $N_{hk}$ is the number of tie variables with value $h$ in one
      wave and value $k$ in the next wave. The Jaccard index is a measure for
      stability; see \citet{SnijdersEA10b}.
      Both for the Hamming distance and the Jaccard index, only those cells
      in the adjacency matrix are counted that have available data in the wave
      at the start \underline{and} the wave at the end of the period concerned.

      If Jaccard indices are very low while the average
      degree is not strongly increasing, this indicates
      that the turnover in the network may be too high to consider
      the data as an evolving network, and perhaps the \SI method
      is not suitable for the data set.
      For networks of the type that are mostly used for this method
      (sparse but not too sparse,
      with average degrees not too different from wave to wave
      and between 2 and 15 for all waves),
      Jaccard values of .3 and higher
      are good; values lower than .2 indicate that there might be difficulties
      in estimation; values lower than .1 are quite low indeed.
      Using the \SI method for two waves with an extremely low Jaccard
      index and average degrees that remain more or less constant
      will mean that the first wave hardly plays a role in the results, and
      for non-conditional estimation it will be close to treating the second wave as
      a sample from the stationary distribution of the network dynamics.
      \index{Jaccard index}

      If Jaccard indices are low because the network is mainly increasing
      (creation of new ties) or decreasing (termination of ties),
      this is no problem for the \SI method. Very sparse networks
      (with most degrees less than 2) also may have lower Jaccard values
      without negative consequences for estimation.
\item When parameters have been estimated, first look at the
     \texttt{overall maximum \\convergence ratio} and the \texttt{t statistics for deviations
      from targets}.
      We say that the algorithm has converged if the former is less than 0.25,
      and the latter all are smaller than 0.1 in absolute value;
      and that it has nearly converged if the former is less than 0.35, and the latter are all
      smaller than 0.15. Results obtained for non-converged estimation
      runs may be misleading. (Very small deviations from these
      values are of course immaterial.) See Section~\ref{S_ccheck}.
\item In rare circumstances, when the data set leads to instability
      of the algorithm, the following may be of use.
      The \textsf{Initial value of the gain parameter} determines the
      step sizes in the parameter updates in the iterative
      algorithm.
      This is the parameter called \textsf{firstg}
      in function \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
      A too low value implies that it takes very long to attain a
      reasonable parameter estimate when starting from an initial
      parameter value that is far from the `true' parameter estimate.
      A too high value implies that the algorithm will be unstable,
      and may be thrown off course into a region of unreasonable
      (e.g., hopelessly large) parameter values. It usually is unnecessary
      to change this, but in some cases it may be useful.
\item If all this is to no avail, then the conclusion may be that the model
      specification is incorrect for the given data set.
\item Further help in interpreting output is in Section~\ref{S_output} of
      this manual.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Getting help with problems}
\label{sec:problems}

For methodological help, consult the tutorial  \citet{SnijdersEA10b} or this manual.
The website, {\small\url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/}~}, contains
various further publications (also in other languages than English) that may
be helpful, as well as example scripts.
There is a users' group for \SI to exchange information and seek technical
advice; the address is {\small\url{https://groups.io/g/RSiena}~}.

For technical problems running \rs, follow the following points.
\begin{description}
\item[Help pages] Study the \R help page for the function you are using and that seems to give
      the problems. This manual complements the help pages,
      but does not replace them!
\item[Check your version of \RS]
  The `News' page of the \SI website gives information about new versions
  of \rs. Details of the latest version available can
  be found at the `Downloads' page.
  The version is
  identified by a version number (e.g.\ 1.4.7).
  You can find the number of your current installed version by
  opening \R, and typing\\
  \verb|packageVersion("RSiena")|   \\
  or \\
  \verb|packageDescription("RSiena")|. The version is
  near the top. It is also displayed at the
  start of \RS output files.
\item[Check your version of \Rn] When there is a new version or revision of \RS
  it will only be available to you automatically if you are running the most
  recent major version of \Rn. (You can force an installation if
  necessary by downloading the tarball or binary and installing from that, but
  it is better to update your \Rn.)
\item [Check both repositories] We have two repositories in use for \rs: CRAN
  and GitHub. The latest version will always be available from
  GitHub. (Frequent updates are discouraged on CRAN, so bug-fixes are likely to
  appear first on GitHub.)
\item[Installation] When using the repository at GitHub, \emph{install} the
  package rather than updating it. Then check the version and revision numbers.
\item[Users' group] Consult the archives of the Users' Group mentioned above, or post
     a message to the Users' Group. In your message,
     please tell which operating system, which version of \Rn, and which version
     of \RS you are using.

\section{Steps of modelling}
\label{S_parts}

The operation of the \RS program is comprised of five main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item input of basic data description (see Section~\ref{S_InputData});
 \item model specification (see Section~\ref{S_modspec});
 \item estimation of parameter values using stochastic simulation
        (see Section~\ref{S_Est});
    the main output of the estimation procedure
    is written to a text file named
    \textsf{\textsl{pname}.txt}, where \textsf{\textsl{pname}} is the name
    specified in the call of \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate};
 \item testing parameters and assessing goodness of fit
        (see Sections~\ref{S_se} and \ref{S_test});
 \item simulation of the model with given and fixed parameter values
        (see Section~\ref{S_sim}).
\end{enumerate}

The normal operation is to start with data input, then specify a
model and estimate its parameters,
assess goodness of fit and the significance of the parameters,
and then possibly continue with new
model specifications followed by estimation or simulation.

\section{Input data}
\label{S_InputData}

\RS is a program for the statistical analysis
of repeated measures of social networks, and requires, at the very
least, network data collected at two or more time points. It is also possible
to include other types of variables in the models -- these are discussed in
Section~\ref{S_datatypes}. Section~\ref{S_internal} describes the most
commonly occuring
data transformations that are done internally by \si.
Finally, Section~\ref{S_usertrans}
shows further options for users to define their data.


\subsection{Data types}
\label{S_datatypes}

As we discussed in Section~\ref{S_datvareff}, dependent variables in {\saom}s are defined from
network or behavioral data. Independent variables (effects) are defined
from individual or dyadic covariate data, which can be constant or varying.
\RS requires each of these data types to have a specific format -- this is
presented in the current section.

In general, data specification in \RS consists of two steps.
First, the role of each variable to be used must be defined using
the functions \sfn{sienaDependent}, \sfn{coCovar}, \sfn{varCovar},
\sfn{coDyadCovar}, \sfn{varDyadCovar}, or \sfn{sienaCompositionChange}.
Second, the variables must be combined into one \sfn{siena} data set by the function
\sfn{sienaDataCreate}.
This function puts together the data set and carries out some
preliminary calculations.

It is advisable to use names of variables
consisting of at most 12 characters. This is because they are used as parts
of the names of effects which can be included in the model, and the effect
names should not be too long.

\RS does not work with case numbers. The correspondence between cases
in the different components of the data set is by the order of the rows
in the data matrices. For a data set with $n$ actors,
each data matrix should have $n$ rows and always the $i$'th row
should correspond to the $i$'th actor.

It is also useful to note here that in case of co-evolution models (those with
more than one dependent networks and/or behaviors), data for all dependent
variables must be available for the same set of time points.


\subsubsection{Network data}

There can be one or more networks in the data set.
Networks can be one-mode or two-mode.
Modes are identified with node sets.
All one-mode networks must have the same node set,
also referred to as `actors'.
If there are some one-mode networks and any two-mode networks,
the first node set of all two-mode networks should be the node set
(actor set) of the one-mode networks.
The choice between one- and two-mode is specified by the argument
\texttt{type} in  the \textsf{sienaDependent} function, which for
networks can be \texttt{oneMode} or \texttt{bipartite};
the latter signifies a two-mode network.
If there are one-mode as well as two-mode dependent networks,
the one-mode networks should be mentioned first in the call of
\textsf{sienaDependent}.


For data specification by  \textsf{sienaDependent}, the network
must be specified as a matrix or array or list of sparse matrix of triples.
The help page for \textsf{sienaDependent} has an example of input
by sparse matrices.

For data specification by
%the graphical interface \textsf{siena01Gui} (documented separately) or by
the function \textsf{sienaDataCreateFromSession},
edge list formats are also allowed. This can be either the
format of the Pajek program, or a raw edge list, here called Siena format.
For large number of nodes (say, larger than 100), the edge list
format is more efficient in use of computer memory.

Note that  \textsf{sienaDataCreateFromSession} is available only
in  \textsf{RSienaTest}.

Sparse matrices, which can be used by input via
\sfn{sienaDependent}, have for running the estimations
the same efficiency as Pajek or Siena format.
%Data input as edge lists will also be made available by means of the
%\textsf{sienaDependent} function (in some future version of \sn).
The three possible formats for digraph input are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Adjacency matrices}.\\
      These can be used in  \textsf{sienaDependent} and in
      \sfn{sienaDataCreateFromSession}.\\
      In the usual case of a one-mode network the adjacency matrix
      is given in a matrix of $n$ rows and $n$ columns
      containing integer numbers.
      The diagonal values are meaningless but must be present.
      In the case of a two-mode network (which is a network with two
      node sets, and all ties are between the first and the second node set)
      the matrix does not have to be
      square, as usually the number of nodes in the first set will not be
      equal to the number of nodes in the second set;
      and if it would be square, the diagonal still would be meaningful.

      Although this section talks only about digraphs (directed graphs),
      for one-mode networks it is
      also possible that all observed adjacency matrices are symmetric.
      This will be automatically detected by \si, and
      the program will then utilize methods for non-directed networks.

      The values of the ties must be 0, 1, or \texttt{NA}
      (not available = missing);
      or 10 or 11 for structurally determined values (see below).

      The help file for \textsf{sienaDependent} shows by examples how the
      specification can be given by sparse matrices.
    \item \emph{Pajek format}.\\
      These can be used in \sfn{sienaDataCreateFromSession}
      (only available in \rst).\\
      If the digraph data file has extension name \texttt{.net}, then the
      program assumes that the data file has Pajek format.
      The file should relate to one observation only,
      and should contain a list of vertices (using the
      keyword \texttt{*Vertices}, together with (currently) a list of arcs,
      using the keyword \texttt{*Arcs}
      followed by data lines according to the Pajek rules.
      These keywords must be in lines that contain no further characters.
      An example of such input files is given in the s50 data set
      that is distributed in the \texttt{examples} directory of the
      source code.
    \item \emph{Siena format}.\\
      These can be used in \sfn{sienaDataCreateFromSession} (only available in \rst).\\
      An edge list is a matrix containing three or four columns:
      from, to, value, wave (optional).\\
      Like the Pajek format, this has the advantage that absent ties (tie
      variables with the value 0) do not need to be mentioned in the data
      matrix. By specifying the waves in the fourth column in the
      \sfn{Siena} format, one matrix can be used to contain data for all
      the waves.
\iffalse
RSiena can read multi wave files but not deal with multi wave R objects.
The format for the multi wave files is

from to value wave

where the from and to are sequential numbers. The waves can be any
numbers, as long as they are in the correct order:
\textsf{RSiena} will relabel
them \texttt{1:nwaves}. And use \sfn{sienaDataCreateFromSession} to read the files in.

Within R it is easy to split data frames by a factor such as wave, using
\texttt{split()}. But you end up with a list which you must then process. If you
are not familiar with R my advice would be to do your data manipulation
outside R. \fi
\end{enumerate}

Missing values must be indicated in the way usual for \Rn,
by \texttt{NA}.
\iffalse
For data specification by the function
\textsf{sienaDataCreateFromSession} (only available in \rst),
instead of \texttt{NA} any numerical code can be used
given that this is indicated to be a missing value code.
\fi

If the data set is such that it is never observed that ties are terminated,
then the network dynamics is automatically specified internally in such a way
that termination of ties is impossible.
(In other words, in the simulations of the actor-based model
the actors have only the option to create new ties or to retain
the status quo, not to delete existing ties.)
Similarly if ties never are created (but only terminated),
then this will be respected in the simulations.
See Section~\ref{S_monotone} and note the possibility
of using \sfn{allowOnly=TRUE}.

\subsubsection{Transformation between matrix and edge list formats}
\label{S_trafos}

The following \R commands can be used for transforming an
adjacency matrix to an edge list, and back again.
If \texttt{a} is an adjacency matrix, then the following commands
can be used to create the corresponding edge list,
called \texttt{edges} here.
 \begin{verbatim}
 # create indicator matrix of non-zero entries of a
 ones <- !a %in%  0
 # create empty edge list of desired length
 edges <- matrix(0, sum(ones), 3)
 # fill the columns of the edge list
 edges[, 1] <- row(a)[ones]
 edges[, 2] <- col(a)[ones]
 edges[, 3] <- a[ones]
 # if desired, order edge list by senders and then receivers
 edges      <- edges[order(edges[, 1], edges[, 2]), ]
 \end{verbatim}
Some notes on the commands used here:\\
These commands can be used not only if the adjacency matrix
contains only 0 and 1 entries, but also if it contains values
\texttt{NA}, 10, or 11. The possibility of \texttt{NA}
entries requires special attention;
\texttt{\%in\%}
does just what we need, as it quietly says that
\texttt{NA}'s are not \texttt{\%in\%}
anything, returning \texttt{FALSE}, which is transformed to
\texttt{TRUE} by the \texttt{!} function.
The edge list is created having all 0 values and at the end
should have no 0 values at all.

It is more efficient, however, to work with sparse matrices;
this also is done internally in \rs.
Using the \texttt{Matrix} package for sparse matrix manipulations,
the same results can be obtained as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
library(Matrix)
tmp <- as(a, "dgTMatrix")
edges2 <- cbind(tmp@i + 1, tmp@j + 1, tmp@x)
\end{verbatim}
Conversely, if \texttt{edges} is an edge list, then the following commands
can be used to create the corresponding
adjacency matrix, called \texttt{adj},
with $n$ nodes. (For a bipartite network the two dimensions
will normally be distinct numbers.)
\begin{verbatim}
# create empty adjacency matrix
adj <- matrix(0, n, n)
# put edge values in desired places
adj[edges[, 1:2, drop = FALSE]] <- edges[, 3, drop = FALSE]
\end{verbatim}
Note that this starts with a matrix having all 0 entries,
and results in a matrix with no 0 entries at all.
To check the results, after doing these two operations, the command
\begin{verbatim}
length(which(a != adj))
\end{verbatim}
should return the value 0.

Note that the basic edge list, \verb|edges|, lacks information as to the size of
the adjacency matrix. \verb|tmp| above is a sparse matrix which is in edge list
format but includes information on the size of the adjacency matrix, and can be
used in a similar way to the original matrix \verb|a| while saving memory space.

For some insight into how this is done with \rs, you could request
\begin{verbatim}
RSiena:::sparseMatrixExtraction0
\end{verbatim}
to see how this function is defined, using either the data set (for \texttt{i == NULL})
or the simulated data from \sfn{siena07} (for \texttt{i != NULL}).


\subsubsection{Behavioral data}

\RS also allows dependent behavior variables. This can be used in studies
of the co-evolution of networks and behavior, as described
in \citet*{SnijdersEA07} and \citet*{SteglichEA10}.
These behavior (or `action') variables represent
the actors' behavior, attitudes, beliefs, etc.
The difference between dependent behavior variables and changing actor
covariates (see below) is that the latter
have values determined by the input data and are assumed to
change exogenously, i.e., according
to mechanisms not included in the model, while the dependent
action variables change endogenously, i.e.,
depending on their own values and on the changing network.
Unlike the changing individual covariates,
the values of dependent action variables are not assumed to be
constant between observations.

Dependent behavioral variables can be ordinal discrete or continuous.
This is indicated by the values \texttt{behavior}  or \texttt{continuous},
respectively, for keyword \texttt{type} in \sfn{sienaDependent}.

Ordinal discrete behavioral variables must have nonnegative integer values;
e.g., 0 and 1, or a range of integers like 0,1,2 or 1,2,3,4,5.
The number of different values should not be too high: ten values
is on the high side, but can still be totally adequate.
For categorization of variables that originally are
continuous or have many values, it often is advisable to take
approximately equal intervals on the original scale, and to achieve
a rather smooth distribution of values, which might resemble a
discretized normal or skew distribution, as the case may be.
Using a small number of values may amount to a loss of information.
If the original variable is continuous then 8 to 10 categories may be
a good number. This is studied in \citet[][Chapter 6]{Niezink2018a}.

Each dependent action variable must be given in one
matrix, containing $M$ columns, corresponding to the $M$
observation moments.

If any values are not integers but \texttt{type=behavior},
a warning will be printed on the initial report
given by \sfn{print01Report} and the values will be truncated towards zero.

A special case of behavioral data can be used for
\emph{diffusion of innovations} \citep{Greenan15}:
here the behavior variable representing
having adopted the innovation is binary, coded 0 or 1, and
changes $1 \Rightarrow 0$ are impossible.
Model specifications that are especially useful for this data type
are presented in Section~\ref{S_behRate}.


\subsubsection{Continuous behavioral data}

For continuous behavioral data,
see \url{https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~nynke/code.html}.


\subsubsection{Individual covariates}

Individual (i.e., actor-bound, or monadic) variables
are defined by the functions
\sfn{coCovar} in the case they are constant over time,
and \sfn{varCovar} if they are changing over time.

Each constant actor covariate has one value per actor
valid for all observation moments, and has the role of an
independent variable.

Changing variables can change between observation moments;
then they are called `changing individual covariates',
and have the role of independent variables.

The internal operation of \RS is not scale-independent.
It is advisable to scale the covariates so that they have
standard deviations in the range between 0.1 and 10.

Changing individual covariates are assumed to have constant values from one
observation moment to the next. If observation moments for the
network are $t_1, t_2, ..., t_M$, then the changing covariates
should refer to the $M-1$ moments $t_1$ through $t_{M-1}\,$, and
the $m$-th value of the changing covariates is assumed to be valid
for the period from moment $t_m$ to moment $t_{m+1}\,$.
The value at $t_M$, the last moment, does not play a role.
Changing covariates, as independent variables, are meaningful
only if there are 3 or more observation moments,
because for 2 observation moments the distinction between
constant and changing covariates is not meaningful.

Each changing individual covariate must be specified
in a separate call of \sfn{varCovar}, using for input
an $n \times (M-1)$ matrix where the columns correspond to the $M-1$ periods
between observations.

By default, the mean is subtracted from the covariates.
This can be turned off by constructing the covariate with the keyword
\texttt{centered=FALSE}. Centering of covariates improves
convergence of the estimation algorithm.
Therefore the advice is to use the default (centering) unless there are reasons to
use non-centered covariates, such as when they are used as weights in effects
(e.g., for \texttt{inPopX}).
It is possible to include a given actor variable in the Siena data set
as a covariate in the centered as well as the non-centered version.
See Section~\ref{S_center} on centering.

\iffalse
When an actor covariate is constant within waves, i.e.,
within each wave it has the same value for all actors;
or, more generally, when within each wave it has the same value for
all actors
within components separated by structural zeros (which means that
ties between such components are not allowed), then only the ego effect
of the actor covariate is made available.
This is because the other effects then are meaningless.
This may cause problems for combining several data sets
in a multi-group data set (see Section~\ref{S_multigroup}).
If at least one case is missing (i.e., has the missing value data code),
then the other covariate effects are made available.
When analysing multiple data sets in parallel,
for which the same set of effects is desired to be included,
it is therefore advisable to give data sets in which
a given covariate has the same value for all actors
one missing value in this covariate; purely to make
the total list of effects independent of the observed data.

   * The exclusion in effects.r of effects if the variance of a covariate is 0,
     or a covariate has only two values, is dropped (these effects have no
     meaning, but their exclusion was a potential nuisance for meta-analyses).
\fi



\subsubsection{Dyadic covariates}

Like the digraph data, also each measurement of a dyadic covariate
must be contained in a separate matrix.
For one-mode data this is a square data matrix,
and the diagonal values are meaningless.
%Pajek input format is currently not possible for dyadic covariates.

A distinction is made between constant and changing dyadic
covariates, where change refers to changes over time. Each constant
covariate has one value for each pair of actors, which is valid for
all observation moments, and has the role of an independent
variable. Changing covariates, on the other hand, have one such
value for each period between measurement points. If there are $M$
waves (i.e., observation moments) of network data,
this covers $M-1$ periods, and accordingly,
for specifying a single changing one-mode dyadic covariate,
a $n \times n \times (M-1)$ array is needed.

Two-mode dyadic covariates also are possible; see the help pages for
\sfn{coDyadCovar} and \sfn{coDyadCovar},

The internal operation of \RS is not scale-independent.
It is advisable to scale the covariates so that they have
standard deviations in the range between 0.1 and 10.

Like is the case for monadic  covariates,
changing dyadic covariates are assumed to have constant values from one
observation moment to the next. If observation moments for the
network are $t_1, t_2, ..., t_M$, then the changing covariates
refer to the $M-1$ moments $t_1$ through $t_{M-1}\,$, and
the $m$-th value of the changing covariates is assumed to be valid
for the period from moment $t_m$ to moment $t_{m+1}\,$.
The value at $t_M$, the last moment, does not play a role.

Constant dyadic covariates are specified using function
\sfn{coDyadCovar}, and changing dyadic covariates by \sfn{varDyadCovar}.

The mean is always subtracted from the covariates.
See Section~\ref{S_center} on centering.

\subsection{Internal data treatment}
\label{S_internal}

\subsubsection{Interactions and dyadic transformations of covariates}

For actor covariates (also called monadic covariates),
two kinds of transformations to dyadic covariates
are made internally in \si, by the definition of the
corresponding effects. Denote the actor covariate by $v_i$,
and the two actors in the dyad by $i$ and $j$.
Suppose that the range of $v_i$ (i.e., the difference between the
highest and the lowest values) is given by $r_V$.
The two transformations are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{dyadic similarity} is defined by
\begin{equation}
 \text{sim}^V_{ij} \,=\, 1 - \frac{ \vert v_i - v_j \vert }{ r_V } \ .
            \label{simV}
\end{equation}
      This similarity measure is 1 if
      the two actors have the same value, and 0 if one has the highest and the
      other the lowest possible value.
      For the various similarity effects, this measure
      is centered by subtracting the mean over all dyads,
      so the mean of this similarity variable becomes 0.    \\
      The advantage of this similarity measure is that its coefficients
      are comparable in the sense that the measure always ranges
      between 0 and~1.  \\
      The mean of (\ref{simV}) is calculated by function
      \textsf{sienaDataCreate} and stored as the \sfn{simMean} attribute
      of \texttt{mydata\$cCovars\$myvar}, where \texttt{mydata} is the name
      of the object created by \textsf{sienaDataCreate}, and \texttt{myvar}
      is the name of the variable used as the argument for
      \textsf{sienaDataCreate}, while the name \texttt{cCovars} applies for
      constant monadic covariates, and is to be replaced by \texttt{vCovars}
      for changing (varying) monadic covariates;
      for centering issues, further see Section~\ref{S_center}.
\item \emph{same $V$} is defined by
\begin{equation}
 \text{same}^V_{ij} \,=\,
        \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \text{ if } v_i \,=\, v_j \\
                          0 & \text{ if } v_i \,\neq\, v_j \ .
    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
      This can also be referred to as \emph{dyadic identity}
      with respect to $V$.
\end{enumerate}
Dyadic similarity is relevant for variables that can be treated as
interval-level variables; dyadic identity is relevant for categorical variables.

In addition, \RS offers the possibility of user-defined two- and three-variable
interactions between covariates; see Section~\ref{S_int_eff}.


\subsubsection{Centering}
\label{S_center}

Individual as well as dyadic covariates can be centered
by the program in the following way.

For individual covariates, the mean value is subtracted
by function \textsf{sienaDataCreate}. The centered values then are stored
(see below),
and all calculations use these centered variables.
For the changing covariates, the mean
value used is the global mean (averaged over all periods).
The values of these subtracted means are reported in the output
of \sfn{print01Report}.
For the multi-group option (section \ref{S_multigroup}),
the subtracted values are the global means across all groups.

Centering is the default.
Centering of covariates can be turned off by specifying
\texttt{centered=FALSE} in the call of \sfn{coCovar},
\sfn{varCovar}, \sfn{coDyadCovar}, or \sfn{varDyadCovar}, respectively.
Centering of covariates improves
convergence of the estimation algorithm.
Therefore the advice is to use the default (centering) unless there are reasons to
use non-centered covariates, such as when they are used as weights in effects
(as is the case, e.g., for effect \texttt{inPopX}).
If some actor variable is to be used as a non-centered covariate,
it is recommended to include it as a covariate in the centered
as well as the non-centered version in the Siena data set,
and use the non-centered version only when it is necessary
to get the appropriate effect definition.

For the dyadic covariates and the similarity variables derived
from the individual covariates, the grand mean is calculated
and stored by function \sfn{SienaDataCreate};
the stored values of the variables are not centered, but the means
are subtracted during the program calculations. (Thus,
dyadic covariates are treated internally by the program differently than
individual covariates in the sense that the mean is subtracted at
a different moment, but the effect is the same; except for multi-group
data sets, see below.)
Unlike the `covariate similarity' effect,
the `same covariate' effect is not centered but keeps its 0-1 values.

For the multi-group option (section \ref{S_multigroup}),
dyadic covariates are treated \underline{differently} from
individual covariates:
for dyadic covariates in multi-group data sets, centering is done by the
within-group mean;
actor covariates in multi-group data sets  created by \sfn{sienaGroupCreate}
are centered by the overall mean.

For dependent behavioral variables, the effects are defined
in Section~\ref{S_ff_b} as functions of centered variables.
% See overallMean() in BehaviorLongitudinalData.h

The means of covariates are stored as attributes on the object created by
\textsf{sienaDataCreate}.
If you wish to access them, the following steps can show
where these means can be found.
For example, suppose that the command given was
\begin{verbatim}
mydata <- sienaDataCreate( friendship, smoke1, alcohol )
\end{verbatim}
The structure of this object is obtained by requesting
\begin{verbatim}
str(mydata, 1)
\end{verbatim}
Looking at the response, you
will see that this object contains (among other things):
\begin{enumerate}
\item the constant actor covariates as \texttt{mydata\$cCovars}
\item the varying actor covariates as \texttt{mydata\$vCovars}
\item the constant dyadic covariates as \texttt{mydata\$dycCovars}
\item the varying dyadic covariates as \texttt{mydata\$dyvCovars}
\item the dependent behavioral variables as \texttt{mydata\$depvars}
\end{enumerate}
Since \texttt{smoke1} is a constant covariate and \texttt{alcohol}
a changing covariate, their means can be requested by
\begin{verbatim}
attr(mydata$cCovars$smoke1, "mean")
attr(mydata$vCovars$alcohol, "mean")
\end{verbatim}
and the centered values for, e.g, the variable \texttt{alcohol} by
\begin{verbatim}
mydata$vCovars$alcohol
\end{verbatim}
The mean of the similarity variable is stored as the \sfn{simMean} attribute,
and is obtained by, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
attr(mydata$cCovars$smoke1, "simMean")
\end{verbatim}

The formula for balance is a kind of dissimilarity between rows of
the adjacency matrix. The mean dissimilarity is subtracted in this
formula, having been calculated according to a
\hyperlink{T_meanbal}{formula given in Chapter}~\ref{S_math}.
It is also reported in the
 output file produced by \sfn{print01Report} and available -- e.g., for the first
dependent variable -- as
\begin{verbatim}
attr(mydata\$depvars[[1]], "balmean")
\end{verbatim}
Instead of \texttt{[[1]]} you can request a different number or
the name of the variable.
\smallskip

For multi-group data sets constructed by function \sfn{sienaGroupCreate},
the attribute \texttt{"vCovarMean"} contains the overall means
of the actor covariates.


\subsubsection{Centering of behavioral variables}

Dependent behavior variables are not centered by \textsf{sienaDataCreate},
but internally during the simulations.
Therefore their mean is not stored in the Siena data set.
However, the values and their frequencies are stored in
(using \texttt{mydat} and \texttt{smoke} as example names)
\begin{verbatim}
attr(mydata$depvars$smoke, "vals")
\end{verbatim}
From this, the mean can be calculated by using the functions
\begin{verbatim}
theMean <- function(x){
# Mean of a named vector of frequencies, where the names are the values
    sum(as.integer(names(x)) * x, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
meanByWave <- function(x, vari, w){
    theMean(attr(x$depvars[[vari]], "vals")[[w]])
}
grandMean <- function(x, vari){
    xxx <- attr(x$depvars[[vari]], "vals")
    mean(sapply(xxx, theMean))
}
\end{verbatim}
For comprehensibility, these three functions are given separately here.
The first is a general utility function, the second and third specific for \rs.
They can be applied, e.g., as
\begin{verbatim}
grandMean(mydata, "smoke")
sapply(1:mydata$observations, meanByWave, x = mydata, vari = "smoke")
\end{verbatim}
and for multi-group data as
\begin{verbatim}
sapply(myGroupData, grandMean, vari = "smoke")
\end{verbatim}





\subsubsection{Monotonic dependent variables}
\label{S_monotone}


In some data sets, a dependent variable only increases, or only decreases.
For a network, this means that ties can be created but not terminated,
or the other way around.
This may be the case for all periods (a period is defined by the
two consecutive observation waves at its start and end points)
or just in some of the periods.
\RS will note when a dependent variable only increases or only decreases
in any given period,
and mention this in the output file generated by \textsf{print01Report}.
This constraint then is also respected in the simulations, in the periods
where it is observed.
This is represented
internally by a variable called \texttt{uponly} indicating that the
dependent variable cannot decrease,
and a variable \texttt{downonly} indicating that the
dependent variable cannot increase.
The constraints signaled by the  \texttt{uponly} and  \texttt{downonly}
variables can be lifted by using \texttt{allowOnly = FALSE}
in the call of \textsf{sienaDependent} (see the help file for this function).

If a dependent variable is only increasing or only decreasing
for all periods and \textsf{sienaDependent} was called with
\sfn{allowOnly=TRUE} (the default),
then two basic effects are not identified.
These are the outdegree effect for a dependent network variable,
and the linear shape effect for a dependent behavior variable;
these effects define the balance between the probabilities of
going up and going down.
These effects then are dropped automatically from the effects object.
If this is not desired, this can be prevented
by calling \textsf{sienaDependent} with \sfn{allowOnly=FALSE}.


\subsubsection{Multivariate dependent variables with constraints}
\label{S_constraints0}

When analysing multiple dependent networks, it is possible that they
are related in some deterministic way. For example, two networks
might be mutually exclusive (this could be the case for negative and positive
ties -- although there are many cases where positive
and negative ties may coexist!), or networks could be ordered, i.e.,
one network could be a sub-network of the other
(networks with ordinal tie values represented as a multivariate network).
This is treated in Section~\ref{S_constraints}.


\subsection{Further data specification options}
\label{S_usertrans}

\subsubsection{Structurally determined values}
\label{S_struct}

It is allowed that some of the values in the digraph are
structurally determined, i.e., deterministic rather than random.
This is analogous to the phenomenon of `structural zeros' in
contingency tables, but in \RS not only structural zeros but also
structural ones are allowed. A structural zero means that it is
certain that there is no tie from actor $i$ to actor $j$; a
structural one means that it is certain that there is a tie. This
can be, e.g., because the tie is impossible or formally imposed,
respectively.

For estimation by the Method of Moments,
structural zeros provide an easy way to deal with actors leaving
or joining the network between the start and the end
of the observations: specify all their incoming and outgoing tie
variables, at the moment that they are not present, as structural zeros.
Note that actors having all values specified as structural zeros in this way
take part of the simulations only starting at the observation moment
where they are not totally structurally zero;
therefore, this way of representing partially absent actors
is not meaningful for actors who are present only at the very last wave.
In particular, this includes the case where there are two waves only
for actors who join the network after the first wave.

Another way (more complicated but more flexible,
because it gives possibilities to represent actors
entering or leaving at specified moments between observations)
is the method of joiners and leavers, described in Section~\ref{S_comp}.
For actors present only at the last wave, the method of
joiners and leavers is preferable.

When endowment or creation effects are to be included in the
model specification, changing structural values should not be used,
and the method of joiners and leavers then also is preferable.

It should be noted that if the model also contains behavioral dependent
variables and structural zeros are used to represent changing
composition of the network (or networks), the behavioral dependent variables
still will be possible to change. To keep them from changing for the absent
actors, a non-centered dummy actor variable can be used which is 1~for the absent
actors and 0~for all others, and which is given a fixed \texttt{RateX} effect
for the behavioral variables of a large negative value, e.g., --100;
this effect should be fixed and \underline{not} tested.
\bigskip

Structurally determined values are defined by reserved codes in
the input data: the value 10 indicates a structural zero, the
value 11 indicates a structural one. Structurally determined
values can be different for the different time points. (The
diagonal of the data matrix for a one-mode network
always is composed of structural
zeros, but this does not have to be indicated in the data matrix
by special codes.) The correct definition of the structurally
determined values can be checked from the brief report of this in
the output file of \textsf{print01Report} --- which is given only,
however, if the diagonal entries of the one-mode networks are also
set to 10.

If there are a lot of structurally determined values
then unconditional estimation  (see Section~\ref{S_cond})
is preferable.

When \RS\ simulates networks including some structurally determined values,
if these values are constant across all observations then
the simulated tie values are likewise constant.
If the structural fixation varies over time, the situation
is more complicated.
Consider the case of two consecutive observations
$m$ and $m+1$,
and let $X^{\text{sim}}_{ij}$ be the simulated value
at the end of the period from $t_m$ to $t_{m+1}$.
If the tie variable $X_{ij}$ is structurally fixed at time $t_m$
at a value $x_{ij}(t_m)$,
then $X^{\text{sim}}_{ij}$ also is equal to $x_{ij}(t_m)$,
independently of whether this tie variable is structurally fixed
at time $t_{m+1}$ at the same or a different value or not at all.
This is the direct consequence of the structural fixation.
On the other hand, the following rule is also used.
If $X_{ij}$ is \emph{not} structurally fixed at time $t_m$
but it is structurally fixed at time $t_{m+1}$ at some value $x_{ij}(t_{m+1})$,
then in the course of the simulation process from  $t_m$ to $t_{m+1}$
this tie variable can be changed as part of the process in the usual way,
but after the simulation is over and before the statistics are calculated it will be fixed
to the value $x_{ij}(t_{m+1})$.

The target values for the algorithm of the Method of Moments estimation
procedure are calculated for all observed digraphs $x(t_{m+1})$.
However, for tie variables $X_{ij}$ that are
structurally fixed at time $t_m$, the observed value  $x_{ij}(t_{m+1})$
is replaced by the structurally fixed value  $x_{ij}(t_{m})$.
This gives the best possible correspondence between target values
and simulated values in the case of changing structural fixation.

For estimation by Maximum Likelihood, treated in Section~\ref{S_ML},
structural zeros operate differently than for the Method of Moments,
and probably it is not a good idea to use changing
structural zeros; see Section~\ref{S_ML}.
\bigskip

Structural zeros offer the possibility of analyzing several
networks simultaneously under the assumption that the parameters
are identical.
However, a preferable option to do this is
the multi-group option of Section~\ref{S_mulev}.

The following explanation of the option of using structural zeros
to analyze several networks simultaneously is given mainly
for historical reasons (to understand earlier publications);
\underline{this is not a recommended option}.

E.g., if there are three networks with 12, 20 and
15 actors, respectively, then these can be integrated into one
network of 12 + 20 + 15 = 47 actors, by specifying that ties
between actors in different networks are structurally impossible.
This means that the three adjacency matrices are combined in one
$47 \times 47$ data matrix, with values 10 for all entries that
refer to the tie from an actor in one network to an actor in a
different network. In other words, the adjacency matrices will be
composed of three diagonal blocks, and the off-diagonal blocks
will have all entries equal to 10. In this example, the number of
actors per network (12 to 20) is rather small to obtain good
parameter estimates, but if the additional assumption of identical
parameter values for the three networks is reasonable, then the
combined analysis may give good estimates.

In such a case where $K$ networks (in the preceding paragraph, the
example had $K = 3$) are combined artificially into one bigger
network, it will often be helpful to define $K-1$ dummy variables
at the actor level to distinguish between the $K$ components.
These dummy variables can be given effects in the rate function
and in the evaluation function (for `ego"), which then will
represent that the rate of change and the out-degree effect are
different between the components, while all other parameters are
the same.

It will be automatically discovered by \RS\ when monadic covariates
depend only on these components defined by structural zeros,
between which tie values are not allowed.
For such variables, only the ego effects are defined
and not the other effects defined for the regular
actor covariates and described in Section ~\ref{S_eff_cov}.
This is because the other effects then are meaningless.
If at least one case is missing,
then the other covariate effects are made available.


\subsubsection{Missing data}
\label{S_missing}

\RS allows that there are some missing data on network variables,
on covariates, and on dependent action
variables.  Missing data must be indicated by
the usual missing data code for \Rn, \texttt{NA}.

Missingness of data is treated as non-informative.
One should be aware that having many missing data can seriously
impair the analyses: technically, because estimation will be
less stable; substantively, because the assumption of
non-informative missingness often is not quite justified.
Up to $10\%$ missing data will usually not give many difficulties
or distortions, provided missingness is indeed non-informative
\citep{HuismanSteglich08}.
When one has more than $20\%$ missing data on any variable, however,
one may expect problems in getting good estimates.

In the current implementation of \si, missing data are treated in
a simple way, trying to minimize their influence on the estimation
results.
This method is further explained in \citet{HuismanSteglich08},
where comparisons are also made with other ways of dealings with the missing
information. The default method in \RS for handling missings in the dependent
variable is the fourth method as described in \citet{HuismanSteglich08}.

The basic idea is the following.
\medskip

A brief sketch of the procedure is that
missing values are imputed to allow meaningful simulations;
for the calculation of the target statistics in the Method of Moments,
tie variables and actor variables with missings are not
used.
More in detail, the procedure is as follows.

The simulations are carried out over all variables,
as if they were complete.
To allow this, missing data are imputed.
In the initial observation, missing entries in the adjacency
matrix are set to 0,
i.e., it is assumed that there is \emph{no} tie;
this is done because normally data are sparse, so `no tie'
almost always is the modal value of the tie variable.
In the further observations, for any tie variable,
if there is an earlier observed value of this variable then
the last observed value is used to impute the current
value (the `last observation carry forward' option,
cf.\ \citet{Lepkowski89}); if there is no earlier observed
value, the value 0 is imputed.
For the dependent behavior variables a similar principle
is used: if there is a previous observation of the same variable
then this value is imputed, if there is none but there
is a next observation then this is imputed, if this also is absent
then the observationwise mode of the variable is imputed.
Missing covariate data are, by default, replaced by the
variable's global mean; but in the definition of actor covariates,
by the functions \sfn{coCovar} or \sfn{varCovar}, the user
has the option to supply other values for imputation of the missings.
In the course of the simulations, however, the imputed values of the dependent
behavior variables and of the network variables are allowed to change.
\medskip

In order to ensure a minimal impact of missing data treatment on
the results of parameter estimation (Method of Moments estimation)
and/or simulation runs, the calculation of the target statistics
used for estimation by the Method of Moments, and reporting in these
procedures uses only non-missing data.
When for an actor in a given period, any variable is missing that is
required for calculating a contribution to such a statistic, this
actor in this period does not contribute to the statistic in
question. For network and dependent behavior variables, the tie variable
or the actor variable, respectively,
must provide valid data both at the beginning and at the end of a
period for being counted in the respective statistics.
This is implemented as follows: if a tie variable is missing in wave $m$,
for the calculation of observed as well as simulated target statistics
for periods $m-1$, $m$, and $m+1$ it is replaced by the value 0;
if a dependent behavior variable is missing in wave $m$,
for the calculation of observed as well as simulated target statistics,
where always the centered values are used, for periods $m-1$, $m$, and $m+1$
the value is replaced by 0 (which, given the centering,
is equivalent to the overall mean).

For non-centered covariates, the treatment of missing data is less
well thought out; this may cause problems in the analysis
of data with a lot of missing values for non-centered covariates.
\medskip

By using the argument \texttt{imputationValues} in \sfn{coCovar}
and \sfn{varCovar}, other values
(i.e., values different from the mean that is used by default
for imputation) can be given for imputation of missings
in monadic covariates.
These are then used for the simulations; since they were indicated as missings
(\texttt{NA}) in the data themselves, they will not be used for the calculation
of target statistics in the Method of Moments.
\medskip

For estimation by Maximum Likelihood, missing values in the dependent variables
at the end of a period are treated in a model-based way.
For missings at the start of a period, independent priors are used.
However, periods are treated separately: simulations in period $m$ do not help
provide information for period $m+1$.
See
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}
for a further description.
\medskip

The default method in \RS for treating missing behavioral data in \RS was compared
with several alternative methods in \citet{ZandbergHuisman2019}, and was found to
perform quite well.

There is ongoing work by Robert Krause and others about using
multiple imputation for \RS modeling;
see \citet{KHS2018}.
A script illustrating this for longitudinal network analysis
is at the Siena scripts webpage,
\url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/multipleImputation_for_RSiena.R}
Methods for co-evolution studies are in preparation.


\subsubsection{Composition change: joiners and leavers}
\label{S_comp}

\RS can also be used to analyze networks of which the composition
changes over time, because actors join or leave the network
between the observations.
This can be done in two ways: using the method of \citet{HuismanSnijders03},
or using structural zeros.
(For the maximum likelihood estimation option, the Huisman-Snijders method
is not implemented, and only the structural zeros method can be used.)
Structural zeros can specified for all elements of the tie variables
toward and from actors who are absent at a given observation moment.
How to do this is described in subsection~\ref{S_struct}.
This is straightforward and not further explained here.
This subsection explains the method of Huisman and Snijders
(2003), also called the method of joiners and leavers,
which uses the information about composition change
in a somewhat more efficient way.

Network composition change, due to actors joining or leaving the
network, is handled separately from the treatment of missing data.
The data matrices must contain all actors who are part of the
network at any observation time.
If adjacency matrices are used as data input, they must therefore
all have the same number of $n$ rows, each actor
having a separate (and fixed) line in these matrices, even for
observation times where the actor is not a part of the network
(e.g., when the actor did not yet join or the actor already left
the network).

The \emph{times of composition change} can be given
either in a data file or in a list available in the \R session.
For networks with constant composition
(no entering or leaving actors), this file or list is
omitted and the current subsection can be disregarded.

If there is composition change, estimation by the Method of Moments
is forced to be unconditional (see Section~\ref{S_cond}).

For these waves, where the actor is not in the network, the entries
of the adjacency matrix can be specified in two ways. First as
missing values using missing value code \texttt{NA}. In the estimation
procedure, these missing values of the joiners before they joined
the network are regarded as 0 entries, and the missing entries of
the leavers after they left the network are fixed at the last
observed values. This is different from the regular missing data
treatment. Note that in the initial data description the missing
values of the joiners and leavers are treated as regular missing
observations. This will increase the fractions of missing data and
influence the initial values of the density parameter.

A second way is by giving the entries a regular observed code,
representing the absence or presence of a tie (as
if the actor was a part of the network). In this case, additional
information on relations between joiners and other actors in the
network before joining, or leavers and other actors after leaving
can be used if available. Note that this second option of
specifying entries always supersedes the first specification: if a
valid code number is specified this will always be used.

The functions used to specify the times actors
join or leave the network (i.e., the times of composition change)
are \sfn{sienaCompositionChangeFromFile} in case a file is used,
and \sfn{sienaCompositionChange} in case a list is used.
How to use a separate input file,
called the \emph{exogenous events file}, is
described in the help page for \sfn{sienaCompositionChangeFromFile}.

In the second case, a list must be given of length $n$,
where $n$ is the number of actors in the node set.
The $i$'th element of this list must be a vector of numbers (characters are also allowed),
composed of an even number of elements, indicating the intervals during
which actor $i$ was present. For example, \texttt{1 4} indicates that the actor
was present from wave 1 to wave 4 (end points included) and
\texttt{1 3.2 5.01 7}
indicates that the actor was present from wave 1 to 20\% of the time between
waves 3 and 4, and then again from just after wave 5 to wave 7.

As an example, suppose we have 50 actors and 6 waves;
almost all actors were present all the time, but actor 11 was present
from wave 3 onward, actor 20 was present until wave 4, and
actor 33 was present from mid-way between waves 1 and 2 until wave 3, and then
again from just after wave 4 to wave 6.
Then the list can be created by the following commands.
\begin{verbatim}
comp <- rep(list(c(1,6)), 50)
comp[[11]] <- c(3,6)
comp[[20]] <- c(1,4)
comp[[33]] <- c(1.5,3,  4.01,6)
changes <- sienaCompositionChange(comp)
\end{verbatim}
(The use of blanks in the line for \texttt{comp[[33]]} is only for visually
keeping the pairs of start-end times together.)

The first line, creating a list with the (default) first and
last end point for everybody, could also be replaced by
\begin{verbatim}
comp <- vector("list", 50)
comp[] <- list(c(1,6))
\end{verbatim}
Here it may be noted that \texttt{[]} keeps structures etc.\ unchanged
while replicating the expression to fit.

The object \texttt{changes} created by the functions
\sfn{sienaCompositionChangeFromFile} or
\sfn{sienaCompositionChange} is of class
\sfn{compositionChange} and can be used in the function
\textsf{sienaDataCreate}.

The method of joiners and leavers for representing composition change
does not combine properly with the \textsf{sienaGOF} function
(Section~\ref{S_gof}).
But if you use \texttt{NA} codes for the tie variables of absent actors,
and these are indicated as such by a \sfn{compositionChange} object, then
\textsf{sienaGOF}  will work properly.

The implementation of endowment and creation effects does not agree
with changing structural zeros or ones. Therefore, if there is
changing composition in a data set and the model should contain endowment
and/or creation effects, the changing composition should be reflected by
a changing composition and not by structural zeros.


\newpage
\section{Model specification}
\label{S_modspec}

\subsection{Definition of the model}
\label{S_defmod}

After defining the data, the next step is to specify a model.
The model specification consists of a selection of `effects'
for the evolution of each dependent variable (network or behavior).
To understand this, first a brief review of the definition of the
actor-oriented model is given
\citep*[for further explanations see][]{Snijders01, Snijders05,
SnijdersEA07, SnijdersEA10b}.

The model is based on four functions, which first are explained in an
intuitive way.
They are defined specifically for all dependent variables (network, behavior,
or more of these if included in the model).
These functions depend on the actor (hence the name `actor-oriented')
and on the state of the network, behavior, and covariates.
All these functions are constituted by a weighted sum
of so-called \emph{effects}, which define the characteristics of
the network (and behavior, if this is included as a dependent variable)
that determine the probabilities of changes.


\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{rate function}\\
The rate function models the speed by which the dependent variable
changes; more precisely: the speed by which each network actor
gets an opportunity for changing her score on the dependent
variable.\\
Advice: in most cases, start modeling with a constant rate function without
additional rate function effects.

When there are important differences between
actors in some measure of size or importance,
it is possible that different advice must be given.
This can be the case, e.g., when the network has a clear
core-periphery structure; or when the outdegree distribution
is very skewed.
Then it may be necessary to let the rate function
depend on the outdegrees or on an individual covariate indicating this size.

\item {\em evaluation function }\\
The evaluation function\footnote{The evaluation function was called
\emph{objective function} in \citet{Snijders01}.}
is the primary determinant of the probabilities of changes.
Probabilities are higher for moving towards states with a higher value
of the evaluation function.
One way of representing this is that the evaluation function
models the actor's `satisfaction'\footnote{The term
`satisfaction' should be interpreted here in a very loose sense;
the satisfaction interpretation is not necessary at all, but it does give
a convenient intuitive way of thinking about the model.}
with her/his local
network neighborhood configuration. It is assumed that actors
change their scores on the dependent variable such that they
improve their total satisfaction -- with a random element
to represent the limited predictability of behavior.
In contrast to the creation and endowment
functions (described below), the evaluation function evaluates only
the local network neighborhood configuration that results from the
change under consideration, without considering `where you come from'.
In most applications, the evaluation function will
be the main focus of model selection.

\newpage
\item {\em creation function }\\
The creation function\footnote{A special case of the {\it gratification
function} in \citet{Snijders01}.}
distinguishes between new and old network
ties (when evaluating possible network changes) and between
increasing or decreasing behavioral scores (when evaluating
possible behavioral changes).
It is a component of the probabilities of change only for changes in
an upward direction: creation of new ties, augmentation of values
of the behavior dependent variable.
Creation effects can be the creation parts of an evaluation effect,
or elementary effects (see below).

In the interpretation using satisfaction, the creation function
models the gain in satisfaction incurred when network ties are created
or behavioral scores are increased.

\item {\em endowment or maintenance function}\\
The endowment function\footnote{The endowment function also is
a special case of the {\it gratification function} in \citet{Snijders01}.},
which also may be called \emph{maintenance function},
also distinguishes between new and old network
ties (when evaluating possible network changes) and between
increasing or decreasing behavioral scores (when evaluating
possible behavioral changes).
It is a component of the probabilities of change only for changes in
a downward direction: maintenance vs.\ termination of existing ties,
decrease of values of the behavior dependent variable.

Again, endowment effects can be the maintenance parts of an evaluation effect,
or elementary effects (see below).

In the interpretation using satisfaction, the endowment function
models the loss in satisfaction incurred when network ties are dissolved or
behavioral scores are decreased (hence the label `endowment').
\end{itemize}

Leaving aside the rate effects, a given effect can normally be included
in the model in any of the three `types' or `roles' of
evaluation, creation, or endowment effect.
In almost all cases, the advice is to
start modeling without any creation or endowment effects,
and add them perhaps at a later stage.
For example, if the network dynamics in a given data set is such
that ties mainly are created, and they are dissolved rather rarely,
then the data will contain little information about the question whether
creating ties follows different rules than dissolving ties,
and if one would try to include   creation or endowment effects
for effects already included in the evaluation function,
this would lead to large standard errors.
Creation and endowment effects for behavior for behavior variables with more
than 2 values are still under investigation, and their interpretation
for practical research still is uncertain.

A model specification with only evaluation effects and without creation and
endowment effects leads to exactly the same network dynamics as a specification
where these effects are turned into creation and endowment effects,
if the same parameters would have exactly the same values.
For any given effect, it makes no sense to include the effect
in all three roles: evaluation, creation, endowment.
If one wishes to go beyond evaluation effects, then the user has to choose
between adding an effect in either the creation or the endowment role.

For any effect, the model specifications of (evaluation \& creation),
(evaluation \& endowment), and (creation \& endowment) are equivalent,
and pairs of parameters can be directly transformed into each other
(cf.\ Section~\ref{S_c}),
but the estimates by the Method of Moments will not have the same correspondence
because different pairs of target statistics are used.
Each of the pair specifications could be tried out, in principle.
Perhaps the first two pair specifications, containing the evaluation
effect and one of the other two, give the most precise estimates;
but this is not necessarily always the case.


\subsubsection{Elementary effects}
\label{S_elementary}

Not all contributions  to the probability of change can be written
as the change in some basic function (evaluation function).
Therefore we sometimes need to directly represent contributions to a
tie change or behavior change, without invoking an evaluation function.
This can be done by using elementary effects.
(In \citet{Snijders01} this was called a gratification function;
as a more neutral term, we now use the word `elementary effects'.)
\smallskip

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{.8\textwidth}
The basic example here is transitive closure, which can be represented
by the tendency toward forming closed triplets as in this figure.
When the focal actor is $i$, ties that lead to the closure are
$i \rightarrow j$ and $i \rightarrow h$; but the first of these ties
means the closing of a two-path $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j$, while
the second means forming a tie to an actor $h$ who made the same outgoing
choice to the third actor $j$, a sign of structural equivalence;
so these are distinct processes.
The evaluation effect corresponding to the tendency toward forming
closed triples
is the \texttt{transTrip} effect, which is composed of the
two distinct elementary effects
\texttt{transTrip1}, contributing to creating or maintaining the $i \rightarrow j$ tie,
and \texttt{transTrip2}, contributing to the $i \rightarrow h$ tie;
see Section~\ref{S_math}.
\end{minipage}

\end{minipage}
\smallskip

An elementary effect is a contribution to the creation or maintenance of a tie,
defined directly, i.e., without expressing it based on the
change in some evaluation function.
This means that elementary effects are more general than
evaluation effects, and all effects could be represented as elementary effects.
For the sake of interpretation, however, the evaluation function formulation
is used whenever possible.

Elementary effects can apply similarly to the creation and maintenance of a tie;
or they can apply exclusively to tie creation, or exclusively to tie
maintenance. In \RS the difference between elementary effects and evaluation effects
is only in the internal programming code, and the
possible values of the \texttt{type} of effect
as specified in the effects object and the
functions \sfn{includeEffects} and \sfn{setEffect}
are only \texttt{eval}, \texttt{creat}, and \texttt{endow}.
In Chapter~\ref{S_math} almost all effects are evaluation effects,
and the effects that are elementary (and not evaluation) effects
are mentioned as such.

\subsubsection{Specification in \RS}

The model specification is defined in \RS by the so-called
\emph{effects object}, which formally is an object of class
\sfn{sienaEffects} or, for multiple groups as discussed in Chapter~\ref{S_mulev}
of class \sfn{sienaGroupEffects}.
It is a special kind of \sfn{data.frame}.
The effects object is originally created by the function \textsf{getEffects} and
subsequently modified by functions \sfn{includeEffects},
\sfn{setEffects}, and others.
The scripts on the \SI website give examples.
An important ingredient here is the so-called \sfn{shortName}
of each effect, a column of the data frame, which is used to identify it.
For the practical use of \si, the \sfn{shortName}s are very important.
Effects of covariates (and of other dependent variables used in
the role of explanatory variable for the effect in question)
need, in addition, the name of the covariate
because the \sfn{shortName} does not specify the covariate.
If there are several dependent variables (networks and/or behavioral variables),
the name of the dependent variable (\sfn{name}) also is required
to specify the effect, and will be given in the column \sfn{interaction1}
(etc.) of the effects object.

The distinction between evaluation, endowment, and creation effects is
specified by the \sfn{type} of the effect; this can be
\texttt{eval}, \texttt{endow}, or \texttt{creation}.
The default is \texttt{eval}.
Only for rate effects this distinction does not exist;
their \sfn{type} is \texttt{rate}.
The \sfn{type} can be set in the functions \sfn{includeEffects},
\textsf{setEffect}, and \sfn{includeInteraction}.

A list of all effects available in the current version of
\RS with their \sfn{shortName}s can be displayed in a browser
by using the function:

\verb|effectsDocumentation()| \\

A list of all effects available for the given effects object, e.g.,
\texttt{myeff} -- which depends on the set of variables and the number of periods
in the data object --  can be displayed in a browser
by requesting

\verb|effectsDocumentation(myeff)| \\

For example, the command
\begin{verbatim}
cbind(myeff$effectName, myeff$type, myeff$shortName)[1:20,]
\end{verbatim}
gives a list of the first 20 effects in the \texttt{myeff} object.
As another example,
\begin{verbatim}
cbind(myeff$effectName, myeff$type, myeff$shortName)[myeff$type == "eval",]
\end{verbatim}
lists all evaluation effects in \texttt{myeff},
and
\begin{verbatim}
unique(myeff$shortName)
\end{verbatim}
gives the set of all \sfn{shortName}s.

\subsubsection{Mathematical specification}
\label{S_mathmod}

To attach precise meaning to the intuitive explanations above,
the mathematical definition of the model is given as follows.
To keep notation simple, we leave all statistical parameters out of the
formulae. To keep the section short, we do not give a lot of explanation,
but refer to the mentioned literature for that purpose.

As explained in \citet*{SnijdersEA10b}, the model is a continuous-time
Markov chain, and represents how the network (and behavior) has changed
in small steps (the so-called \emph{ministeps}) from one observed
to a later observed value. Each ministep entails a change in only
one tie value, or one behavioral variable, and is modeled as follows.

First consider the network dynamics.
At any given moment, let the network be denoted $x^0$.
The rate function for actor $i$ is denoted $\lambda_i(x)$;
the evaluation function is $f_i(x)$; the creation function is $c_i(x)$;
and the endowment function is $e_i(x)$.

At any given moment, let the current network be denoted $x^0$.
The time duration until the next opportunity of change
is exponentially distributed with parameter
\[
  \lambda_+(x^0) \,=\, \sum_i \lambda_i(x^0) \ .
\]
This means that the expected time duration is
\[
   \frac{1}{\lambda_+(x^0)} \ .
\]
The probability that actor $i$ will be the next to
have an opportunity for change is
\[
  \frac{\lambda_i(x^0)}{\lambda_+(x^0)} \ .
\]
Now suppose that actor $i$ is the one who has the next opportunity
for change; one could say, this is the focal actor.
Actor $i$ then has the possibility to change one network tie,
or to keep the network as it is.
Denote by $\mathcal C$ the set of all networks that can be obtained
as a result.
Then the probability of the network obtained from this step depends on
something called the objective function $u_i(x^0, x)$ which will be defined
in a moment.
Let $x \in \mathcal C$ be some network that could be obtained as a result
of the ministep; then $x$ will be the same as $x^0$, except perhaps for
the tie $i \rightarrow j$ for some $j$; this tie might exist in $x$ but not in
$x^0$, or vice versa.
The probability that the next network is $x$ is given by
\begin{equation}
     \frac{\exp(u_i(x^0, x)\big)}
          {\sum_{x' \in \mathcal C} \exp\big(u_i(x^0, x')\big)} \ . \label{probab}
\end{equation}
The numerator is required to make all probabilities for this step sum to 1.

The objective function is defined as follows.
If there is only an evaluation function (mathematically, this means that
the creation and endowment functions are 0), then
the objective function is equal to the evaluation function for the new state,
\[
   u_i(x^0, x) \,=\, f_i(x) \ .
\]
Because of the properties of the exponential function one can just as
well define the objective function as the gain in evaluation function,
\begin{equation}
   u_i(x^0, x) \,=\, f_i(x) - f_i(x^0) \ .    \label{gain}
\end{equation}
To define the general case, note that if $x^0$ and $x$ are not the same,
then they differ in only one tie variable $x_{ij}$.
Define  $\Delta^+(x^0, x) = 1$ if $x$ has one tie more than $x^0$,
meaning that a tie is created by this change, and $\Delta^+(x^0, x) = 0$
otherwise.
Similarly, define  $\Delta^-(x^0, x) = 1$ if $x$ has one tie less than $x^0$,
meaning that a tie is dissolved by this change, and $\Delta^-(x^0, x) = 0$
otherwise.
Then the general definition of the objective function is
\begin{align}
   u_i(x^0, x)  \,=\,  \label{u_i}   &
      \big(f_i(x) -  f_i(x^0)\big)  \\
                &   \,+\,   \Delta^+(x^0, x)\,\big(c_i(x) - c_i(x^0)\big)
                   \,+\,  \Delta^-(x^0, x)\,\big(e_i(x) - e_i(x^0)\big)    \ . \nonumber
\end{align}
This shows that the change in creation function plays a role
only if a tie is created ($\Delta^+(x^0,x) = 1$), and the change in
endowment function plays a role
only if a tie is dissolved ($\Delta^-(x^0,x) = 1$).

If also elementary effects are included, then denote the linear combination
for a tie variable $x_{ij}$
for general (evaluation-type) elementary effects by  $f^{\rm{el}}_{ij}(x)$, for creation
elementary effects by  $c^{\rm{el}}_{ij}(x)$, and for endowment elementary effects
by  $e^{\rm{el}}_{ij}(x)$.
To the objective function $ u_i(x^0, x)$ we then still have to add
\[
     f^{\rm{el}}_{ij}(x) \,+\,   \Delta^+(x^0, x)\, c^{\rm{el}}_{ij}(x)
                   \,+\,  \Delta^-(x^0, x)\,e^{\rm{el}}_{ij}(x) \ .
\]

For behavior dynamics the definitions are analogous.
Here a basic assumption is that, when there is an opportunity for change,
the possible new values for the behavior variable are the current
value, this value +1, and this value --1, as long as these changes
do not take the value out of the permitted range.
More elaborate explanations are in
\citep*{SnijdersEA07, SnijdersEA10b, SteglichEA10, VeenstraEtAl2013}.

The evaluation, creation, and endowment functions are constructed as a
linear combination of the effects:
\begin{equation}  \label{obj.fu}
f_i(x) \, = \, \sum_k \beta_k \, s_{ik}(x)
\end{equation}
where $\beta_k$ are parameters and $s_{ik}(x)$ are effects.
For models with more than one dependent variable (networks, behaviors),
this is specific to each dependent variable; e.g., in a network and behavior
study with one network and one behavioral variable, there will be two evaluation
functions.
Because of formula (\ref{gain}), what is essential for the effects for networks
is the difference
\begin{equation}
   \Delta_{kij} (x) \,=\,  s_{ki}\big(x^{+ij}\big) \, - \,  s_{ki}\big(x^{-ij}\big)  \label{changestat0}
\end{equation}
where $x^{+ij}$ is network $x$ with the tie $i \rightarrow j$
and $x^{-ij}$ is network $x$ without this tie.
This is called the \emph{change statistic}.

Elementary effects are defined by
\[
    s^{\rm el}_{ijk}(x) \, = \, x_{ij}\,s^{\rm el0}_{ijk}(x) \ ,
\]
for a statistic $s^{\rm el0}_{ijk}(x)$ which does not depend on $x_{ij}$. Therefore,
the corresponding change statistic is
\[
    \Delta^{\rm el}_{kij} (x) \,=\, s^{\rm el0}_{ijk}(x) \ .
\]




\subsection{Important structural effects for network dynamics:
           \protect\newline one-mode networks}
\label{S_imp_str1}

For the structural part of the model for network dynamics,
for one-mode (or unipartite) networks,
the most important effects are as follows.
The mathematical formulae for these and other effects are given
in Chapter~\ref{S_math}. Here we give a more qualitative description.

A default model choice could consist of (1) the out-degree (density)
and reciprocity effects; (2) one network closure effect,
e.g.\ transitive triplets, transitive ties, or gwesp;
the transitive reciprocated triplets effect
and/or the 3-cycles effect;
(3) the in-degree popularity effect (raw or square root version);
the out-degree activity effect (raw or square root version);
and either the in-degree activity effect or the out-degree popularity effect
(raw or square root function).
The two effects (1) are so basic they cannot be left out.
The effects selected under (2) represent the dynamics in local (triadic) structure
\citep[also see][for the transitive reciprocated triplets effect]{Block2015};
and the three effects selected under (3) represent the dynamics
in in- and out-degrees (the first for the dispersion of in-degrees,
the second for the dispersion of out-degrees, and the third for the
covariance between in- and out-degrees) and also should offer
some protection, albeit imperfect, for potential ego- and alter-effects
of omitted actor-level variables.

Information about basic contact opportunities, if available,
should also be taken into account. This can be, e.g., membership
of the same classroom or department, or some measure of
proximity used as a dyadic covariate. Especially for large networks
(more than 100 nodes) this is important.

The basic list of these and other effects is as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{out-degree (density) effect} which always must be included,
      to give the balance between creation and termination of ties
      (conditionally on all other effects), and has the role of an intercept.
\item The \emph{reciprocity effect} which practically always must be included.
\item There is a choice among several network closure effects.
      Usually it will be sufficient to express the tendency to network
      closure by including one or two of these. They can be selected
      by theoretical considerations and/or by their empirical
      statistical significance and contribution to a good fit.

      In older publications, when the gwesp effect was not available, it was
      sometimes advised to include the transitive triplets together with the transitive
      ties effect. Currently, the impression is that often the gwesp effect
      is at least as good as a combination of transitive triplets and transitive
      ties. For many data sets, a model containing either the transitive triplets
      effect or the gwesp effect (not both) is adequate to represent transitivity,
      and the user may try out which of these yields the best fit.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
      \begin{minipage}[t]{.6\textwidth}
      The \emph{transitive triplets effect}, which is
               the classical representation of network closure by the number of transitive
               triplets.
               For this effect the contribution
               of the tie $i \rightarrow j$ is proportional to the total number
               of transitive triplets that it forms -- which can be transitive triplets
               of the type
               $\{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow h ;\ i \rightarrow h \}$
               as well as $\{i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j ;\ i \rightarrow j \}$;
      \end{minipage}

\endpicture
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
      \item[b.] The \emph{transitive ties effect} is similar to the transitive
                triplets effect, but instead of considering for each other actor $j$
                how many two-paths $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j $ there are,
                it is only considered whether there is at least one such indirect connection.
                Thus, one indirect tie suffices for the network embeddedness.
      \item[c.] The \emph{gwesp} effect; see later in this manual.
                Figure~\ref{F_gwesp2} shows that the contribution of the number of
                two-paths for the gwesp effect is between that for the transitive
                ties effect ($\alpha = 0$) and for the transitive
                triplets effect ($\alpha = \infty$). The default for gwesp
                is  $\alpha = 0.69$, corresponding to an internal effect
                parameter of 69.
      \item[d.] There are various other effects that may express network closure,
                such as the \emph{balance} effect, the
                \emph{Jaccard similarity effects} for incoming and for outgoing ties,
                and the \emph{number of actors at distance two effect}.
                The balance and Jaccard similarity effects are ways to express
                tendencies to structural equivalence.
                The number of actors at distance two effect expresses network
                closure inversely:
                stronger network closure (when the total number of ties is fixed)
                will lead to fewer geodesic distances equal to 2.
                When this effect has a negative parameter, actors will have a preference
                for having few others at a geodesic distance of 2 (given their
                out-degree, which is the number of others at distance 1);
                this is one of the ways for expressing network closure.
                However, it is theoretically ambiguous, because the number of
                others at a geodesic distance of 2 can be decreased in two
                quite different ways: dropping ties to those who have many
                connections `further out', or making ties to those who have many
                connections to others to whom one is already directly connected.
      \end{enumerate}
\item
      \begin{minipage}[t]{.7\textwidth}
      The \emph{three-cycles effect}, which can be regarded as
      generalized reciprocity (in an exchange interpretation
      of the network) but also as the opposite of hierarchy
      (in a partial order interpretation of the network).
      A negative three-cycles effect, together with a positive
      transitive triplets or transitive ties effect, may be
      interpreted as a tendency toward local hierarchy.
      The three-cycles effect also contributes to
      network closure.\\
      \citet{Block2015} has argued convincingly that instead of the
      three-cycles effect, it is often advisable to use the
      transitive reciprocated triplets effect.\\
      In a non-directed network, the three-cycles effect is identical
      to the transitive triplets effect.

\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\item Another triadic effect is the \emph{betweenness effect},
      which represents brokerage: the tendency for actors
      to position themselves between not directly connected
      others, i.e., a preference of $i$ for ties
      $i \rightarrow j$ to those $j$
      for which there are many $h$ with
      $h \rightarrow i$ and $h \not\rightarrow j$.
      This can, however, not be combined with the transitive triplets
      effect because it is a different mechanism leading to the
      same structures.\\
      The betweenness effect has the property that it is defined using
      configurations characterized by the \underline{absence} of certain ties,
      not only by their presence.
      This leads to difficulties in interpretation, and may be undesirable.

\item[{\hspace*{-1ex}$\bigodot$}]
     The following eight degree-related effects may be important especially for networks
     where degrees are theoretically important and represent social status
     or other features important for network dynamics;
     and/or for networks with high dispersion in in- or out-degrees
     (which may be an empirical reflection of the theoretical importance
     of the degrees).\\
     The out-degree popularity and in-degree activity effects are closely
     related; their raw (not-sqrt) versions are exactly collinear in the
     Method of Moments.\\
     Degree assortativity are higher-order effects, and will be included
     mainly if there are strong theoretical reasons for them.

\item The \emph{in-degree popularity effect} (again, with or without `sqrt',
     with the same considerations applying)
     reflects tendencies to dispersion in in-degrees of the actors;
     or, tendencies for actors with high in-degrees to attract extra incoming ties
     `because' of their high current in-degrees.
\item The \emph{out-degree popularity effect} (again, with or without `sqrt',
     with the same considerations applying)
     reflects tendencies for
     actors with high out-degrees to attract extra incoming ties
     `because' of their high current out-degrees.
     This leads to a higher correlation between in-degrees and out-degrees.
\item The \emph{in-degree activity effect} (with or without `sqrt')
     reflects tendencies for
     actors with high in-degrees to send out extra outgoing ties
     `because' of their high current in-degrees.
     This leads to a higher correlation between in-degrees and out-degrees.
     The in-degree activity and out-degree popularity effects are
     not distinguishable in Method of Moments estimation; then the choice between them
     must be made on theoretical grounds.
\item The \emph{out-degree activity effect} (with or without `sqrt')
     reflects tendencies for
     actors with high out-degrees to send out extra outgoing ties
     `because' of their high current out-degrees.
     This also leads to dispersion in out-degrees of the actors.
\item The \emph{in-in degree assortativity effect} (where parameter 2 is the same
    as the sqrt version, while parameter 1 is the non-sqrt version)
     reflects tendencies for actors with high in-degrees
     to preferably be tied to other actors with high in-degrees.
\item The \emph{in-out degree assortativity effect} (with parameters
     2 or 1 in similar roles)
     reflects tendencies for actors with high in-degrees
     to preferably be tied to other actors with high out-degrees.
\item The \emph{out-in degree assortativity effect} (with parameters
     2 or 1 in similar roles)
     reflects tendencies for actors with high out-degrees
     to preferably be tied to other actors with high in-degrees.
\item The \emph{out-out degree assortativity effect} (with parameters
     2 or 1 in similar roles)
     reflects tendencies for actors with high out-degrees
     to preferably be tied to other actors with high out-degrees.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Rate function}

In some cases the rate function needs special attention.
This can be the case, e.g., when the network has a clear
core-periphery structure; or when the outdegree distribution
is very skewed.
Then it may be necessary to let the rate function
depend on the outdegrees, using one of the three effects \texttt{outRateLog},
\texttt{outRateInv}, or \texttt{outRate};
or on an individual covariate indicating this size.
Experience shows that often a rate dependence on outdegrees gives
best results, and that \texttt{outRateLog} often is preferable.
See Section~\ref{S_r}.

The \SAOM for two-mode (or bipartite) networks
is treated in \citet{KoskinenEdling2012}.
The co-evolution of one-mode and two-mode networks is treated in
\citet{SLT2013}.
The most important effects are as follows.
The mathematical formulae for these and other effects are given

\subsection{Effects for network dynamics associated with covariates}
\label{S_eff_cov}

For each individual covariate, there are several effects which
can be included in a model specification, both in the network
evolution part and in the behavioral evolution part (should there be
dependent behavior variables in the data).
Of course for two-mode networks, the covariates must be compatible
with the network with respect to number of units (rows/columns).
%The following list is very incomplete.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em network rate function}
\begin{enumerate}
\item the covariate's effect on the rate of network change of the
actor;
\end{enumerate}
\item {\em network evaluation, creation, and endowment functions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item the covariate-similarity effect, which is suitable for variables
      measured on an interval scale (or at least an ordinal scale
      where it is meaningful to use the absolute difference
      between the numerical values to express dissimilarity);
      a positive parameter implies that actors prefer
      ties to others with similar values on this variable --
      thus contributing to the
      network-autocorrelation of this variable not by changing
      the variable but by changing the network;\\
      for categorical variables, see the `same covariate'
      effect below;
\item the effect on the actor's activity (covariate-ego);
      a positive parameter will imply the tendency that
      actors with higher values on this covariate
      increase their out-degrees more rapidly;
\item the effect on the actor's popularity to other actors (covariate-alter);
      a positive parameter will imply the tendency that
      the in-degrees of actors with higher values on this covariate
      increase more rapidly;
\item the effect of the squared variable
      on the actor's popularity to other actors (squared covariate-alter)
      (included only if the range of the variable is at least 2).
      This normally makes sense only if the covariate-alter effect
      itself also is included in the model.
      A negative parameter implies a unimodal preference
      function with respect to alters' values on this covariate;
\item the interaction between the value of the covariate
      of ego and of the other actor (covariate ego $\times$ covariate alter);
      a positive effect here means, just like a positive similarity effect,
      that actors with a higher value on the covariate
      will prefer ties to others who likewise have a relatively high
      value;
      when used together with the alter effect of the squared variable
      this effect is quite analogous to the similarity effect,
      and for dichotomous covariates, in models where the ego and
      alter effects are also included, it even is equivalent
      to the similarity effect (although expressed differently),
      and then the squared alter effect is superfluous;
\item the `same covariate', or covariate identity, effect, which expresses the tendency of the
      actors to be tied to others with exactly the same value on the covariate;
      whereas the preceding four effects are appropriate for interval scaled
      covariates (and mostly also for ordinal variables),
      the identity effect is suitable for categorical variables;
\item the interaction effect of covariate-similarity with reciprocity;
\item the effect of the covariate of those to whom the actor isf
      indirectly connected, i.e., through one intermediary but not
      with a direct tie; this value-at-a-distance can represent
      effects of indirectly accessed social capital.
%\item
%several other interaction effects of the covariate or
%covariate-similarity with endogenous network effects;
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
The usual order of importance of these covariate effects on
network evolution is: evaluation effects are most important, followed
by creation, endowment and rate effects. Inside the group of evaluation
effects, for variables measured on an interval scale
(or ordinal scale with reasonable numerical values),
it is the covariate-similarity effect that is most
important, followed by the effects of covariate-ego and
covariate-alter.

When the network dynamics is not smooth over the observation waves --- meaning that
the pattern of ties created and terminated, as reported in the initial part of the
output file produced by \sfn{print01Report}
under the heading \emph{Initial data description -- Change in networks --
Tie changes between subsequent observations},
is very irregular across the observation periods --- it can be important to include
effects of time variables on the network.
Time variables are changing actor covariates that depend only on the
observation number and not on the actors. E.g., they could be dummy variables,
being 1 for one or some observations, and 0 for the other observations.

For actor covariates that have the same value for all actors within observation
waves,
or -- in the case that there are structurally determined values --
that are constant for all actors within the same connected components,
only the ego effects are defined, because only those
effects are meaningful.
This exclusion of the alter, similarity and other effects for
such actor variables applies only to variables without any missing values.

For each dyadic covariate, the following network evaluation effects
can be included in the model for network evolution:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em network evaluation, creation, and endowment functions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item main effect of the dyadic covariate;
\item the interaction effect of the dyadic covariate with reciprocity.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
The main evaluation effect is usually the most important.
But dyadic covariates can also be transformed, e.g., to patterns
of indirect connections, which then are again usable as dyadic covariates.
Dyadic covariates can also be used in various ways as weights
for behavioral evolution.

\subsection{Cross-network effects for dynamics of multiple networks}


If there are multiple dependent network variables, these can be
one-mode networks, two-mode networks, or a combination of these.
The co-evolution of one-mode and two-mode networks is treated in
\citet{SLT2013}, but this paper can also be used as an introduction
to the dynamics of multiple one-mode networks.
For multiple dependent network variables,
the following effects may be important.
This is explained here jointly for the case of one-mode and two-mode
networks. The \emph{number of columns} is defined as the number of actors
for one-mode networks, and as the number of units/nodes/...
in the second node set for two-mode networks.
For cross-network effects the network in the role of dependent variable
is denoted by $X$ and the network in the role of explanatory variable
by $W$; thus, effects go from $W$ to $X$.
All these effects are regarded as effects determining the dynamics of network $X$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If both networks have the same number of columns,
      then the basic effect is the entrainment of $X$ by $W$,
      i.e., the extent to which the existence of a tie
      $i \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} j$ promotes
      the creation or maintenance of a tie $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$.
\item If both networks are one-mode,
      then a next effect is the reciprocity effect with $W$ on  $X$,
      representing the extent to which the existence of a tie
      $j \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} i$ promotes
      the creation or maintenance of a tie,
      in the reverse direction, $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$.
\item If both networks are one-mode,
      then a next effect is the mutuality effect with $W$ on  $X$,
      representing the extent to which the existence of a mutual tie
      $i \stackrel{W}{\leftrightarrow} j$ promotes
      the creation or maintenance of a tie $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$.
\item The \emph{outdegree W activity effect} (where parameter 2 is
    the sqrt version, while parameter 1 is the non-sqrt version -- see above
    for explanations of this) reflects the extent to which actors
    with high outdegrees on $W$ will make more choices in the
    $X$ network.

\item[{\hspace*{-1ex}$\bigodot$}] Several mixed transitivity effects can be important.
\item
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
If $X$ is a one-mode network, the \emph{from W agreement} effect

      of a tie $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$.

\subsection{Hierarchy requirements}



From linear regression we know that when a model contains an interaction
effect, usually also the corresponding main effects should be included.
Similarly for higher-order interactions, their lower-order terms
will usually be included.
This is called the \emph{hierarchy} principle in model building.

The situation for structural effects in {\saom}s is similar but more complex.

For covariate effects the considerations are similar to those
in regression analysis and do not need reiteration.
% Andrea's klas12b heeft een voorbeeld van een interactieeffect zonder hoofdeffect:
% ethniciteit * tijd.
The hierarchy principle for the \saom\ is that when an effect
represented by some graphical structure is included in the model,
the effects for the \underline{sub-structures that are part of the
structure} should also be included.
In other words, testing of higher-order structures implies that
the corresponding lower-order structures should also be included.

An example is the transitive triplets effect \textit{transTrip}.

\caption{Transitive triplets and included subgraphs}
\label{F_triplets.hierarchy}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{F_triplets.hierarchy} we see
the transitive triplet together with the three two-arc
configurations that it contains as subgraphs.
These correspond, respectively, to the indegree-activity
or outdegree-popularity effect, the indegree-popularity effect,
and the outdegree-activity effect.
To use the test of the transitive triplets effect
as evidence for or against transitivity it is necessary
that the model includes these three effects (for the first
it does not matter whether \textit{inAct} or \textit{outPop}
is chosen).
Note the condition ``\textit{to use the test of the transitive triplets effect
as evidence for or against transitivity}'';
if the purpose is just to obtain a well-fitting model,
then it might be superfluous to include all three lower-order effects.

This principle also applies to multivariate networks as discussed
in the previous section.



\subsection{Constraints between networks}
\label{S_constraints}

When analysing multiple dependent networks, the following constraints
between networks can be considered:
\begin{description}
  \item[disjoint:] for any given pair of actors $(i,j)$,
      it is impossible that ties exists in both networks;
  \item[higher:] the tie variables for the first network
      are higher than or equal to those for the second network:
      for any given pair of actors $(i,j)$,
      it is impossible that a tie exists in the second
      but not in the first network;
  \item[atleastone:] for any given pair of actors $(i,j)$,
     there must be a tie in at least one of the networks.
\end{description}
Whether this is so, is indicated in the attributes of the data set
(of class \texttt{siena}).
These constraints are observed and set during the creation of the
\texttt{siena} object in \textsf{sienaDataCreate}.
When one of the constraints is true,
this will be reported in the output of \textsf{print01Report}.
These constraints will continue to be respected during the simulations
(and by implication for the estimations).
The constraints for the simulations can be changed
(e.g., turned off) by function \sfn{sienaDataConstraint}.

Script \url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/RscriptSienaOrdered.R}\\
gives a demonstration of how this feature can be used for analyzing networks
with ordered values.
\medskip

Constraints will work for all pairs of networks of the same kind:
both networks directed one-mode, both symmetric (non-directed) one-mode,
or both two-mode with the same node sets.
For the combination of a one-mode directed and a symmetric non-directed
network, the constraint \textbf{disjoint} is possible;
and the constraint \textbf{higher} is possible,
if the symmetric network is higher than the directed network.

Constraints do not work for multi-group data sets! By implication,
they do not work for \textsf{sienaBayes}.


\subsection{Effects on behavior evolution}
\label{S_eff_beh}

For models with one or more dependent behavior variables, i.e.,
models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior,
the most important effects for the behavior dynamics are the following;
see \citet*{SteglichEA10}.
In these descriptions, with the `alters' of an actor
we refer to the other actors to whom
the focal actor has an outgoing tie.
The dependent behavior variable is referred to as $Z$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The shape effect, expressing the basic drive toward high values on $Z$.
      A zero value for the shape will imply a drift toward the midpoint
      of the range of the behavior variable.
\item The effect of the behavior $Z$ on itself,
      or quadratic shape effect, which is relevant
      only if the number of behavioral categories is 3 or more.
      This can be interpreted as giving a quadratic preference function
      for the behavior.
      When the coefficient for the shape effect is $\beta^Z_1$ and for the
      effect of $Z$ on itself, or quadratic shape effect, is $\beta^Z_2$,
      then the contributions
      of these two effects are jointly $\beta^Z_1\, (z_i - \bar z) \,+\,
                   \beta^Z_2\, (z_i - \bar z)^2$.
      With a negative coefficient $\beta^Z_2$, this
      is a unimodal preference function, with the maximum attained
      for $z_i \,=\, \bar z - 2\,\beta^Z_1/\beta^Z_2$.
      (Of course additional effects will lead to a different picture;
      but as long as the additional effects are linear in $z_i$ -- which is not
      the case for similarity effects! --, this will change the location of the maximum
      but not the unimodal shape of the function.)
      This can also be regarded as negative feedback, or a self-correcting
      mechanism: when $z_i$ increases, the further push toward higher values
      of $z_i$ will become smaller and when $z_i$ decreases, the further push toward lower values
      of $z_i$ will become smaller. On the other hand, when the coefficient $\beta^Z_2$
      is positive, the feedback will be positive, so that changes in $z_i$
      are self-reinforcing. This can be an indication of addictive behavior.
\item The average similarity effect, expressing the preference of actors
      to being similar with respect to $Z$ to their alters,
      where the total influence of the alters is the same
      regardless of the number of alters.
\item The total similarity effect, expressing the preference of actors
      to being similar to their alters,
      where the total influence of the alters is proportional to
      the number of alters.
\item The average alter effect, expressing that actors
      whose alters have a higher average value of the behavior $Z$,
      also have themselves a stronger tendency toward high values on the behavior.
\item The total alter effect, expressing that actors
      whose alters have a higher total value of the behavior $Z$,
      also have themselves a stronger tendency toward high values on the behavior.
\item The indegree effect, expressing that actors with a higher indegree
      (more `popular' actors) have a stronger tendency toward high values on the behavior.
\item The outdegree effect, expressing that actors with a higher outdegree
      (more `active' actors) have a stronger tendency toward high values on the behavior.
\end{enumerate}
Effects 1 and 2 will practically always have to be included as control variables.
(For dependent behavior variables with 2 categories, this applies only to effect 1.)
When the behavior dynamics is not smooth over the observation waves --- meaning that
the pattern of steps up and down, as reported in the initial part of the
output file produced by \sfn{print01Report}
under the heading \emph{Initial data description -- Dependent actor variables -- Changes},
is very irregular across the observation periods --- it can be important to include
effects of time variables on the behavior.
Time variables are changing actor covariates that depend only on the
observation number and not on the actors. E.g., they could be dummy variables, being 1
for one or some observations, and 0 for the other observations.

The average similarity, total similarity, average alter, and total effects
are different specifications of social influence.
The choice between them will be made on theoretical grounds
and/or on the basis of statistical significance.
Do not include them all together in one model, as this would most likely
lead to multicollinearity and non-convergence.
\medskip

For each actor-dependent covariate as well as for each of the other
dependent behavior variables,
the effects on $Z$ which can be included is the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The main effect: a positive value implies that actors with a
      higher value on the covariate will have a stronger tendency
      toward high $Z$ values.
\item Various effects of the combination of covariate values for members
      of the personal network of the focal actor (outgoing ties, incoming
      ties, distance-two ties): search in this manual for \texttt{avXAlt,
      avXInAlt, avXAltDist2, avXInAltDist2} and their manifold variations.
\item Interactions between two or three actor variables, see
      Section~\ref{S_int_eff}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Type}
\label{S_modeltype}

When the data is perfectly symmetric, this will be detected by \si.
Then the analysis options for nondirected networks will be followed.

%The Model Type is specified in the
%\hyperlink{T_S_options}{model options} as (part of) the
%\hyperlink{T_modelcode}{Model Code}.

\subsubsection{Model Type: directed networks}

These are currently not implemented in \SI 4.
\fi

\iffalse
For directed networks, the Model Type distinguishes between
the model of \citet{Snijders01} (Model Type 1),
that of \citet{Snijders03} (Model Type 2),
and the tie-based model described in \citet{Snijders06} (Model Type 3).
Model Type 1 is the default model and is
described in the basic publications on {\saom}s for network dynamics.

Model type 2 is at this moment not implemented in \SI version 3.
\medskip
\fi

\iffalse
In Model Type 2, the `decisions' by the actors
consist of two steps: first a step to increase or decrease their
out-degree; when this step has been taken, the selection of the
other actor towards whom a new tie is extended (if the out-degree
rises) or from a an existing tie is withdrawn (if the out-degree
drops).
The decision by an actor to increase or decrease the number of outgoing ties
is determined on the basis
of only the current degree; the probabilities of increasing or
decreasing the out-degree are expressed by the distributional
tendency function $\xi$ (indicated in the output as \emph{xi}) and
the volatility function $\nu$ (indicated as \emph{nu}). Which new
tie to create, or which existing tie to withdraw, depends in the
usual way on the evaluation, creation, and endowment functions. Thus, the
outdegree distribution is governed by parameters that are not
connected to the parameters for the structural dynamics. The use of
such an approach in statistical modeling minimizes the influence of
the observed degrees on the conclusions about the structural aspects
of the network dynamics. This is further explained in \citet{Snijders03}.

For Model Type 2, in the rate function, effects connected to these
functions $\xi$ and $\nu$ are included. On the other hand, effects
in the evaluation function that depend only on the out-degrees are
canceled from the model specification, because they are not
meaningful in Model Type 2. To evaluate whether Model Type 1 or
Model Type 2 gives a better fit to the observed degree distribution,
the output gives a comparison between the observed out-degrees and
the fitted distribution of the out-degrees (as exhibited by the
simulated out-degrees). For Model Type 2 this comparison is always
given. For Model Type 1, this comparison is given by adding 10 to the
Model Code in the advanced options. (For \LaTeX\ users: the log
file contains code that can be used to make a graph of the type
given in \citet{Snijders03}.

For using Model Type 2, it is advised to first estimate some model
according to Model Type 1 (this may be a simple model containing a
reciprocity effect only, but it could also include more effects),
and then -- using the parameters estimated under Model Type 1 --
change the specification to Model Type 2, and use the
\hyperlink{T_S_cond}{unconditional estimation method}
(see Section~\ref{S_cond}) (instead of the conditional method which is the
default). It is likely that the very first model estimated under
Model Type 2 will have results with poor
\hyperlink{T_convergence}{convergence properties}, but in such
cases it is advised just to estimate the same model another time,
now using the parameter values obtained under the previous Model
Type 2 run as the initial values for the estimation.

To obtain a good model specification with respect to the rates of
change in dependence of the out-degrees, three effects can be
included:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the out-degrees effect
\item the factorial out-degree effect
\item the logarithmic out-degree effect.
\end{enumerate}
These are the effects defined in formula (18) of \citet{Snijders03}
and indicated with the parameters $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$,
and $\alpha_3$, respectively.
The user has to see from the estimation results which, or which two,
out of these effects
should be included to yield a good fit for the out-degrees.

In addition these types, there is
Model Type 6 which implements the reciprocity model of \citet{Wasserman79}
and \citet{Leenders95}  \citep[also see][]{Snijders99, Snijders05} ---
provided that no other effects are chosen than
the outdegree effect, the reciprocity effect and perhaps
the reciprocity endowment effect,
and possible also effects of actor covariates or dyadic covariates.
This model is meaningful only as a `straw man" model to provide a test
of the null hypothesis that the dynamics of the dyads are mutually
independent, against the alternative hypothesis
that there do exist network effects (which make the dyad processes
mutually dependent).
For this purpose, Model Type 6 can be chosen,
while for one or more network effects such as the effects
representing transitivity, the null hypothesis is tested that their
coefficients are zero (see Section~\ref{S_test}).

\subsection{Model Type: non-directed networks}
\label{S_modeltype_nd}

Dynamics for non-directed networks is explained in \citet{SnijdersPickup16}.

\RS detects automatically when the networks all are non-directed,
and then employs a model for this special case.
For non-directed networks, the Model Type has five possible values,
as described in \citet{SnijdersPickup16}.
This is specified by the parameter \sfn{modelType} in function
\textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
Value \texttt{modelType = 1} is for directed networks, values
\texttt{2-6} for non-directed networks.

% DependentVariable.h gives the order of the model types:
% 0-6 =
%	enum NetworkModelType { NOTUSED, NORMAL, AFORCE, AAGREE, BFORCE, BAGREE, BJOINT };
% See Siena_algorithms;
% A = unilateral, B = two-sided initiative
% help file: modelType Type of model to be fitted:
% 1=directed, 2:6 for symmetric networks: 2=forcing, 3=Initiative model,
% 4=Pairwise forcing model, 5=Pairwise mutual model, 6=Pairwise joint model

\begin{enumerate}
\item Directed networks option \texttt{modelType = 1} is not used for non-directed networks.
\item Forcing model, \texttt{modelType = 2}: \\ % AFORCE
      one actor takes the initiative and unilaterally
      imposes that a tie is created or dissolved.
\item Unilateral initiative and reciprocal confirmation,
      \texttt{modelType = 3}:\\ % AAGREE
      one actor takes the initiative and proposes a new tie
      or dissolves an existing tie; if the actor proposes a new tie, the other
      has to confirm, otherwise the tie is not created;
      for dissolution, confirmation is not required.\\
      For the confirmation decision, an offset is added to the objective
      function, representing the difference between a binary yes/no choice
      and the multinomial choice of one among $n-1$ tie variables to change.
      This offset is a fixed parameter, not estimated.
      The higher the offset, the more likely it is that the confirmation
      will be given. It is determined
      by the value of \texttt{Offset} in function
      \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}. This parameter must be given as a
      named vector; see the help page for \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
      Plausible values for this offset are in the range from 0 to 3,
      and should slowly increase with $n$ (roughly proportionally to $\log(n)$).
\iffalse
\item Tie-based model:\\
      a random pair of actors is chosen (actor-specific rate functions
      are not used here),
      and the average change in objective function (\ref{u_net})
      for toggling $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$
      is the log-odds of the probability of changing the tie variable.
\fi
\item Pairwise disjunctive (forcing) model, \texttt{modelType = 4}:\\ %BFORCE
      a pair of actors is chosen and reconsider
      whether a tie will exist between them;
      the tie will exist if at least one of them chooses for the tie,
      it will not exist if both do not want it.
\item Pairwise conjunctive model, \texttt{modelType = 5}:\\  % BAGREE
      a pair of actors is chosen and reconsider
      whether a tie will exist between them;
      the tie will exist if both agree,
      it will not exist if at least one does not choose for it.
\item Pairwise compensatory (additive) model,
      \texttt{modelType = 6}:\\ %BJOINT
      a pair of actors is chosen and reconsider
      whether a tie will exist between them;
      this is based on the sum of their objective functions
      for the existence of this tie.\\
      If the evaluation function is symmetric in ego and alter,
      and there are no creation and/or maintenance functions,
      this is the Longitudinal Exponential Random Graph Model
      (`LERGM') of \citet{KoskinenSnijders2013}.
\end{enumerate}
In the first two of these models, where the initiative is one-sided,
the rate function is comparable to the rate function in directed models.
In the last three models, however, the pair of actors is chosen at a rate
which is the \emph{product} of the rate functions
$\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_j$ for the two actors.
This means that opportunities for change of the single tie variable $x_{ij}$
occur at the rate $\lambda_i \times \lambda_j$.
The numerical interpretation is different from that in the first two models.

Some effects specially designed for non-directed networks
are presented in Section~\ref{S_NonDirEff}.


\subsection{Model Type: directed networks}
\label{S_modeltype_dir}

As of version 1.3-22, there are additional model options for dynamics
of directed one-mode networks, specified by the parameter \sfn{modelType} in function
\textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
The value \texttt{modelType = 1} is the default for directed networks, values
\texttt{modelType = 7, 8, 9, 10} are options included for the purpose
of investigating the consequences of details of the specification of the ministep.

These values implement the so-called \emph{double step}.
The ministeps are explained above in Section~\ref{S_logic} and more in detail
in Section~\ref{S_mathmod}.
A double step is defined by a ministep taken by some focal actor $i$;
suppose this means the creation or termination of the tie
$i \rightarrow j$ for some $j$; then a following ministep is taken by actor $j$.
In these model specifications the `pure' ministeps and the double steps
are mixed randomly.
For the respective values \texttt{modelType = 7, 8, 9, 10},
the probability that a double step is taken is, respectively,
0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00.

These model types are not intended for use in regular applications.



\subsection{Model Type: behavior}
\label{S_modeltype_beh}

As of version 1.1-306, there are two model options for dynamics
of behavior, specified by the parameter \sfn{behModelType} in function
\textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
They differ in the treatment of the boundaries of the range of
the behavioral variable.
Recall that the behavioral microsteps consist of the addition
of --1, 0, or +1 to the dependent variable, under the condition
of remaining within the integer range from the minimum~$z^-$ to
the maximum~$z^+$.

If the current value of the behavior is at the boundary,
$z^-$ or $z^+$, then only two possible outcomes remain.
The default is the option available before, with
\texttt{behModelType = 1}. This is also called the \emph{restricting}
model, because the probabilities of the two options are given by
(\ref{probab}), where the set of possible new states
$\mathcal C$ is just the restricted set $\{z^-, z^-+1\}$ in the case
of the minimum, and $\{z^+-1, z^+\}$ in the case of the maximum.

The second option, for
\texttt{behModelType = 2}, is called the \emph{absorbing}
model, because the probabilities of the two options are calculated
as if the variable could go outside of the range, but when such an excursion
occurs it is absorbed into the range again.
Thus, probabilities are calculated according to
(\ref{probab}), with
$\mathcal C = \{z^--1, z^-, z^-+1\}$ or
$\mathcal C = \{z^+-1, z^+, z^++1\}$,
respectively; but the outcome $z^--1$ when it occurs is replaced
by $z^-$, and  $z^++1$ when it occurs is replaced
by $z^+$.
The objective function for the virtual outcome $z^--1$
is taken to be the same as for $z^-$, and similarly for $z^++1$
it is taken to be the same as for $z^+$.


\hypertarget{T_int_eff}{
\subsection{Interaction effects}
}
\label{S_int_eff}

For the \SAOM and other network models, the definition of interaction
effects is not evident. For example, what is the interaction of
reciprocity and transitive triplets? One possibility is the
transitive reciprocated triplets effect (\texttt{transRecTrip})
effect defined in Section~\ref{S_f}.
This definition makes perfect sense; nevertheless, the reciprocal tie could
have been put at a different place than in dyad $(i,j)$
in the picture there --- which would have led
to a different type of interaction `reciprocity $\times$ transitivity'.
Also for interactions between covariates and structural effects,
when the structural effect is expressed by some configuration of ties,
there will usually be several possibilities to choose the actor in the
configuration for which the covariate should be considered, and these will
often lead to different effects.

This leads to a distinction between ad hoc interaction effects and standard
interaction effects.
Ad hoc interaction effects have to be defined specifically in each case,
like \texttt{transRecTrip}; Section~\ref{S_f} contains many other examples.
Standard interaction effects can be defined directly.
The change statistic of a standard interaction effect is the product of the
change statistics of the interacting effects.
This does not always make sense; whether it is permitted
is defined by the `\texttt{interactionType}' of the effects.

Interactions can be specified by the function \sfn{includeInteraction}.
The basis of the implementation is provided by the definition,
by \si, of `unspecified interaction effects'.
The interacting effects are given by
the columns \texttt{effect1} and \texttt{effect2},
and for three-way interaction effects, \texttt{effect3},
in the effects object; they contain the \texttt{effectNumber}
(sequence number in the effects object) of the effects that are interacting.
The interaction effect must be `included' to be part of the model,
but the underlying effects need only be `included' if
they are also required individually.
(In most cases this is advisable.)
The number of possible user-defined interaction effects is limited,
and is set in the call of \sfn{getEffects}.
\medskip

The information necessary for working with interaction effects
-- the interaction types, short names, and sequence numbers
of the effects -- is contained in the document produced
for a given effects object, say \texttt{myeff}, by the function call

\verb|effectsDocumentation(myeff)|

\noindent
Further see the help page for the function \sfn{effectsDocumentation}.
Chapter~\ref{S_math} of this manual also gives the short names of all effects.
The short name of all unspecified interaction effects is \texttt{unspInt}
for network effects, and \texttt{behUnspInt} for behaviour effects.

It should be mentioned that the keywords \texttt{interaction1},
\texttt{interaction2}, and \texttt{interaction3} in functions such as
\sfn{includeEffects} do not point to interactions between effects.
These keywords are used only to exactly specify an effect.
They point to the covariate or other dependent variable used in the effect;
this name was chosen for the keyword because this other variable may
be said to be interacting with the dependent variable (network or behavior).


\subsubsection{Internal effect parameters for interaction effects}
\label{intint}

Function \sfn{setEffect} has a keyword \texttt{parameter} to set the
internal effect parameter, but the function  \sfn{includeInteraction} does not
have this keyword. The reason is that the internal effect parameters for the
interaction are borrowed from the main effects; even if these are
not included in the model.
Setting the internal effect parameters for main effects, without including them
in the model, can be done by \\[0.2em]
\texttt{setEffect(..., parameter=..., include=FALSE)}\\[0.2em]
 as is done in the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
myeff <- setEffect(myeff,outActIntnX,
   name='mynet2',
   interaction1='mynet1', interaction2='alc', parameter=1, include=FALSE)
myeff <- setEffect(myeff,divOutEgoIntn,
   name='mynet2',
   interaction1='mynet1', parameter=1, include=FALSE)
(myeff <- includeInteraction(myeff,outActIntnX,divOutEgoIntn,
   name='mynet2',
   interaction1=c('mynet1', 'mynet1'), interaction2=c('alc', '')))
\end{verbatim}
The main effects are defined by
\[
\sum_j x_{ij}\, \sum_h w_{ih}\,v_h
\] and
\[
  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \text{divi}(1, w_{i+})
\]
where $\text{divi}(a,b)$ is defined as $a/b$ if $b \neq 0$ and 0 if $b=0$;
so the interaction effect included in this way is
\[
\sum_j x_{ij}\,  \Big( \sum_h w_{ih}\,v_h \Big) \times\ \text{divi}(1, w_{i+})
 \,=\,   \sum_j x_{ij}\, \frac{\sum_h w_{ih}\,v_h}{ w_{i+}}
\]
(where the ratio 0/0 is defined as 0), i.e., the ego effect of the
average value of covariate $V$
for those to whom actor $i$ has a $W$-outgoing tie.
\medskip


For a \sfn{sienaFit} object \texttt{ans} created from any effect object,
the effect specification is given by\\[0.3em]
\texttt{ans\$requestedEffects}\\[0.3em]
while the effects object also including the main effect is given by\\[0.3em]
\texttt{ans\$effects}\\[0.3em]
The latter will show, for any included interaction effects,
the internal effect parameters used for main effects
even if they are not included themselves; this gives
a possibility for checking the internal effect parameters
used for the interactions.


\subsubsection{The \texttt{interactionType} of interaction effects}

All effects have a so-called  \texttt{interactionType},
defined by the column \texttt{interactionType} in the effects data frame.
This interaction type defines what is allowed for  definition of interaction effects;
the product of their change statistics should make sense as the change
statistic of some effect.
Further explanation is given in section `Statistics for MoM' of
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}.

For network effects, the interaction type is \texttt{"ego"}, \texttt{"dyadic"},
or \texttt{""} (blank);
for behaviour effects, it is \texttt{"OK"} or \texttt{""}.


\subsubsection{Interaction effects for network dynamics}

The following kinds of user-defined interactions are possible
for network dynamics of directed one-mode networks
as well as bipartite networks.
\begin{description}
\item[a.]
  Ego effects of actor variables can interact with all effects.
  \item[b.] Dyadic effects can interact with each other.
\end{description}
For undirected networks, ego effects can only interact with ego effects and
dyadic effects can only interact with dyadic effects.
Whether an effect is an ego effect or a dyadic effect is defined by
the column \texttt{interactionType} in the effects data frame.
This column is shown in the list of effects that is displayed
in a browser by using the function:

\verb|effectsDocumentation()|
\bigskip

Thus, in directed networks, a two-way interaction must be between two dyadic
effects or between one ego effect and another effect. A three-way interaction
may be between three dyadic effects, two dyadic effects and an ego effect, or
two ego effects and another effect. In undirected networks all three effects
must be either ego or dyadic effect.

All effects used in interactions must be defined on the same network
(in the role of dependent variable): that for
which the `unspecified
interaction effects' is defined.  And all must be
of the same type (evaluation, endowment, or creation effects).

Examples of the use of \sfn{includeInteraction} are as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
myeff <- includeInteraction( myeff, egoX, recip,
                                    interaction1 = c("smoke1", "") )
myeff <- includeInteraction( myeff, egoX, egoX,
                                    interaction1 = c("smoke1", "alcohol") )
\end{verbatim}
Note the \texttt{interaction1} keyword; this keyword is used also
when defining these effects using \sfn{includeEffects} or
\textsf{setEffect}. In this case, however, two effects are defined,
and accordingly the \texttt{interaction1} keyword has two components,
combined by the \sfn{c} function.
For effects such as \texttt{recip} that have no \texttt{interaction1}
keyword, the corresponding string is just the empty string, \texttt{""}.
(Note that the name \texttt{interaction1} does not itself refer to interactions
in the sense of this section.)

Interactions between three effects are defined similarly,
but now the \texttt{interaction1} keyword must combine three components.

The number of network interaction effects that can be created is defined by the
keyword \texttt{nintn} in function \sfn{getEffects}. If you need more
interactions than permitted, just make a new effects object with the
suitably increased value of \texttt{nintn}.

The list of effects in Chapter~\ref{S_math} contains a variety of
interaction effects that cannot be created in this way;
for example, those with short names
\texttt{transRecTrip}, \texttt{simRecipX},  \texttt{avSimEgoX},
and \texttt{covNetNet} (there are many more).
\medskip

For non-directed (symmetric) networks, what makes sense as standard interaction
effects depends on the \texttt{modelType} as well as on the
 \texttt{interactionType} of the effects. These distinctions have not been fully
implemented.

\subsubsection{Interaction effects for behavior dynamics}
\label{S_beh_infl}

For behavior dynamics, interaction effects can be defined
by the user, for each dependent behavior variable separately,
as interactions of two or three actor variables,
again using the function \textsf{includeInteraction}.
These are interactions on the ego level, in line with the
actor-oriented nature of the model.

There are some restrictions on what is permitted
as interactions between behavior effects.
Of course,  they should refer to the same dependent behavior variable.
What is permitted depends on the \texttt{interactionType} of the
effects, which for behavior effects can be \texttt{"OK"}\footnote{The value
is \texttt{"OK"} for the effects of which the
formula as defined in Section~\ref{S_f_b}
is given by $z_i$ multiplied by something not dependent on $z_i$.}
or blank.
A further explanation is given under the heading `User-defined interaction effects'
in Section~\ref{S_ff_b}.
The \texttt{interactionType} of the effects
is shown in the list of effects displayed in a browser by using the function:

\verb|effectsDocumentation()|
\bigskip

The behavioral effects with non-\texttt{"OK"} (i.e., blank)
\texttt{interactionType} include,
in particular, all effects of which the name
includes the word \texttt{"similarity"},
or alternatively, the short name includes the string \texttt{"sim"}.

The requirement for behavior interactions is that,
of the interacting effects, all or all but one have
the value \texttt{"OK"}. Thus, for an interaction between two effects,
one or both should be \texttt{"OK"}; for a three-effect interaction,
two or all three should be \texttt{"OK"}.

The number of behavior interaction effects that can be created is defined by the
keyword \texttt{behNintn} in function \sfn{getEffects}. If you need more
interactions than permitted, just make a new effects object with the
suitably increased value of \texttt{behNintn}.

As an example, suppose that we have a data set with a dependent
network variable \texttt{friendship} and a dependent behavior variable
\texttt{drinkingbeh} (drinking behavior), and we are interested whether
social influence, as represented by the `average alter' effect, differs
between actors depending on whether currently they drink little or much.
Then the commands
\begin{verbatim}
myeff <- includeEffects(myeff, avAlt,
                name = "drinkingbeh", interaction1 = "friendship")
myeff <- includeInteraction(myeff, quad, avAlt,
                name = "drinkingbeh", interaction1 = c("","friendship"))
\end{verbatim}
define a model with the average alter effect (representing social influence)
and an interaction between this and the quadratic shape effect.
Recall that the latter can be regarded
as the effect of drinking behavior on drinking behavior.
Briefly, the interaction is between current drinking behavior
and the average drinking behavior of friends.
By consulting Section~\ref{S_f_b} on the mathematical definitions of the
effects one can derive that this leads to the following objective function;
where it is assumed that also the linear and quadratic shape effects are
included in the model.
\[
f^{\rm beh}_i(x, z) \,=\, \beta^{\rm beh}_1 z_i \,+\, \beta^{\rm beh}_2 z_i^2
        \,+\, \beta^{\rm beh}_3 z_i \,
        \frac{ \sum_j x_{ij}\, z_j }{\sum_j x_{ij}}
       \,+\, \beta^{\rm beh}_4 z_i^2 \,
              \frac{ \sum_j x_{ij}\, z_j }{\sum_j x_{ij}} \ .
\]
\medskip

In addition, there are predefined interactions available
between actor variables and influence, as described in Section~\ref{S_f_b}.

\iffalse
\subsection{Random effects models: unobserved actor heterogeneity}

The network (and behavior) evolution may be affected
by the fact that actors are heterogeneous.
If all relevant actor heterogeneity is observed in the form of actor
covariates,
then actor heterogeneity can be taken into account by including
covariates in the model.
If not all relevant actor heterogeneity is observed,
then more complex models are required, such as random effects models.
Random effects models \citep[see][]{SchweinbergerSnijders07b} allow to take
unobserved actor heterogeneity into account
by assuming that the network (and behavior) evolution is affected
by unobserved
outcomes of actor-dependent random variables (random effects),
which represent the combined effect of the unobserved actor
heterogeneity on the network (and behavior) evolution.

These models can be estimated only using the maximum likelihood
estimation option, see Section~\ref{S_Est}.
The maximum likelihood estimation of random effects models requires
MCMC-based data
imputation of the unobserved random effects (which can be regarded
as missing data).
\SI supplies three alternative MCMC algorithms for the MCMC-based
data imputation of the random effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] random walk M-H,
\item[(2)] autoregressive M-H,
\item[(3)] independence sampler (default).
\end{itemize}
The algorithms require the determination of the scale factor of
the so-called proposal distribution,
which may affect the efficiency of the algorithms and
the accuracy of the results (for a given number of iterations).
It is recommended to choose the default algorithm (3);
and to choose as scale factor of the proposal distribution $0$---which
would be a pointless scale factor, but which communicates to \RS
that the user wishes to leave the determination of the scale factor to
the defaults within the algorithm,
which features an adaptive method for determining suitable scale factors.
In the ideal case, the choice of algorithm does not affect the
parameter estimates---though the efficiency of
the algorithms and the accuracy of the results
(for a given number of iterations) may be affected.

The estimation of random effects models
(i.e., the estimation of the parameters,
including the variances of the random effects)
may be done by either Maximum Likelihood
or Bayesian estimation (see Section~\ref{S_Bayes}).

%The interpretation of the parameter estimates is straightforward;
%the estimates of the variances of the random effects indicate the magnitude
%of the unobserved actor heterogeneity.
\fi

\subsection{Time heterogeneity in model parameters}
\label{S_timetest1}

When working with two or more periods, i.e., three or more waves,
there is the question whether parameters are constant across the periods.
This can be tested by the \textsf{sienaTimeTest} function, as explained
in Section~\ref{S_timetest2}.
To specify a model with time heterogeneous parameters, the function
\sfn{includeTimeDummy} can be used, as follows.
Consider the reformulation of the evaluation function into
\begin{align}
f^{(m)}_{ij}(\mathbf{x})= \sum_k \Big(\beta_k + \delta_k^{(m)} h_k^{(m)}\Big)
                              \,      s_{ik}\big(\mathbf{x}(i \leadsto j)\big)
\label{eq:fmij}
\end{align}
where $m$ denotes the period (from wave $m$ to wave $m+1$
in the panel data set)
and $\delta_k^{(m)}$ are parameters for the effects interacted
with time dummies. You
can include these in your model simply via the function
\begin{verbatim}
myeffects <- includeTimeDummy(myeffects,
                              density, reciprocity, timeDummy = "2,3,6")
\end{verbatim}
which would add three time dummy terms to each effect listed in the function.

We recommend that you start with simple models,
and base the decision to include time heterogeneous parameters
on your theoretical and empirical insight in the data
(e.g., whether the different waves cover a period where the importance
of some of the modeled `mechanisms' may have changed) and
the score type test that is implemented in the \textsf{sienaTimeTest} function,
see Section~\ref{S_timetest2}.

See \citet{Lospinoso2011} for a technical presentation
and examples of how the test works,
and \citet{LospinosoSnijders2019} for relations with
testing goodness of fit (further treated in Section~\ref{S_gof}).


\subsection{Limiting the maximum outdegree}
\label{S_maxdegree}

It is possible to request that all networks simulated have a
maximum outdegree less than or equal to some given value.
This is meaningful only if the observed networks also do
not have a larger outdegree than this number, for any actor at any wave.

This is carried out by specifying the maximum allowed value
in the \textsf{MaxDegree} parameter of the \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}
function, which determines the settings of the algorithm.

\textsf{MaxDegree} is a named vector, which means that its elements
have names. The length of this vector
is equal to the number of dependent networks.
Each element of this vector must have a name
which is the name of the corresponding network.
E.g., for one dependent network called \texttt{mynet}, one could use
\begin{verbatim}
MaxDegree = c(mynet = 10)
\end{verbatim}
to restrict the maximum degree to 10.
For two dependent networks called \texttt{friends} and \texttt{advisors},
one could use
\begin{verbatim}
MaxDegree = c(friends = 6, advisors = 4)
\end{verbatim}

For a single network, the default value 0 is used
to specify that the maximum is unbounded.
For multiple networks, if for one network
there is a bound for the maximum outdegree
 but for another network this should not be bounded, then
 the value 0 will not work,
 but one should use a bound which is at least $n-1$,
where $n$ is the number of actors in the network (or the largest number,
if there are multiple groups).

If the \textsf{MaxDegree} parameter is used for data where
all, or almost all, degrees are equal to this maximum value,
then it is likely that the estimation algorithm will not converge.
A fixed choice design for network data collection is not
compatible with the free choice nature of the \saom.
See \citet{HollandLeinhardt1973} for a discussion of
fixed choice designs and \citet{Znidarsic2012}
for references to more recent literature.

The \textsf{MaxDegree} option does not work for likelihood-based
estimation; therefore, neither ML estimation using \textsf{siena07}

\subsection{Goodness of fit with auxiliary statistics: \textsf{sienaGOF}}
\label{S_gof}

The function  \verb!sienaGOF! in \RS permits users
to assess the fit of the model with respect to
auxiliary statistics of networks, e.g. geodesic distributions,
that are not explicitly fit by a particular effect,
but are nonetheless important features of the network to represent by the
probability model.
This can be used to check, when one has followed the approach to
model specification explained in Sections~\ref{S_imp_str1}
to~\ref{S_eff_beh} -- and explained also in \citet{SnijdersEA10b} --,
whether the end result gives a good representation
also of these other statistics.

The \textsf{sienaGOF} function, proposed and elaborated by
\citet{Lospinoso2012} and presented further
in \citet{LospinosoSnijders2019}, operates basically by comparing
the observed values, at the ends of the periods, with the
simulated values for the ends of the periods.
The differences are assessed by combining the auxiliary statistics
using the Mahalanobis distance.

Various auxiliary statistics are available directly (`out of the box'),
e.g., distributions of indegrees and outdegrees and of behavioral
variables. These are listed in the help page for
\verb!sienaGOF-auxiliary!. Some other auxiliary statistics, requiring
additional packages such as \texttt{igraph} and \texttt{sna},
are available by copying script from the examples in the same help page.
(The reason for this construction is to reduce dependencies
of \RS on other packages.)

The examples in the help pages for \textsf{sienaGOF} and \sfn{sienaGOF-auxiliary}
give ample help for how to use this function.
Also see the script on the \SI website.


\subsubsection{Plots}
The results of \verb!sienaGOF! can be plotted which then produces
\emph{violin plots} \citep{HintzeNelson1998}, which present
the distribution of the statistic as a combination
of a box plot and a smooth approximation to the density
(by a kernel density estimate), with the observed values superimposed.
The violin plots tend to become squiggly when the probability distribution
is concentrated on a few points (integers usually) and, as a consequence,
the density plot tries to approximate a discrete distribution.
For the associated \verb!plot! function, options \sfn{center} and \sfn{scale}
are available to equalize the centers and scales of the various statistics
plotted.
For distributions and cumulative distributions over sets of integers
(e.g., of degrees or geodesic distances)
it often is advisable to use the defaults \sfn{center = FALSE},
\sfn{scale = FALSE}, whereas for sets of statistics for which a common scale
is less important, e.g., triad counts, a clearer picture may be obtained by
plotting with \sfn{center = TRUE}, \sfn{scale = TRUE}.

\subsubsection{$p$-values}
The $p$-values for \textsf{sienaGOF} compare, in the space of outcomes
of the auxiliary statistic (which is a vector,
with a dimension usually between 4 and 20),
the position of the observed data to the cloud of
points formed by the simulated data sets that correspond
to the estimated model. This comparison is with respect to the
`distance' from the center of the cloud of points,
where `distance' is between quotation marks because it is the
Mahalanobis distance, which takes into account the correlations
and different variances of the components of the auxiliary statistic.

This means that very small values of $p$ indicate poor fit.
There is an important difference here between $p=0$ and $p>0$.
Suppose that there are, e.g., 1,000 simulated data sets
(this number is given by \texttt{n3}, the `length of Phase~3');
then the smallest possible non-zero value of $p$ is 0.001.
If $p=0$, the observed data are further away from the center of
the simulated data than any of the simulated data points -- this
could be very far away indeed. If $p=0.001$ or larger, then
the observed data point must be at least somewhere close to or within the
cloud of simulated points, because one or more of the simulated data
points are further away from the center than the observed data.
Concluding, if $p=0$, then with respect to the auxiliary statistic
the fit is poor; it might be rather poor or extremely poor,
and you do not know how extreme it is.

The customary value of $p=0.05$ may be used as a threshold determining
whether the fit is adequate, but this threshold is of even less
importance here than it is in the case of regular hypothesis testing.

If you have a multi-group estimation (see Section~\ref{S_multigroup}),
\textsf{sienaGOF} needs to be applied to each group separately,
using the \texttt{groupName} keyword, usually
\texttt{groupName="Data1"},  \texttt{groupName="Data2"}, etc.\
(see the help page for \textsf{sienaGOF}).

For combining \textsf{sienaGOF} results for multiple groups,
the resulting $p$-values
as calculated for each single group can be combined.
The most suitable method here perhaps is the inverse normal method,
also called Lipt\'{a}k's method; see \citet[][Section C.3]{HedgesOlkin85}.
This methods transforms each $p$-value to a standard normal variate, adds these
and divides by $\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of combined studies,
and tests the result in the standard normal distribution.
%For the $p$-value of sienaGOF, consult the help page of sienaGOF.
For the transformation to standard normal,
you can use the \R function \sfn{qnorm}
(check whether you need \texttt{qnorm(p)} or \texttt{qnorm(1-p)}).
For testing in the standard normal you can use \sfn{pnorm}.

Another good combination procedure is
Fisher's method for combining independent $p$-values, described also in
\citet{HedgesOlkin85} and (briefly) in \citet[Chapter 3]{SnijdersBosker12}.
The basic idea is that, for groups $k = 1, \ldots, K$
which have given the $p$-values $p_k$, the test statistic is
$- 2 \sum_k \ln(p_k)$ and it is tested in a chi-squared distribution
with d.f.\ = $2K$.

\subsubsection{Composition change, missing data, and structural values in \textsf{sienaGOF} }


The method of joiners and leavers for representing composition change
(Section~\ref{S_comp}) does not combine properly with the \textsf{sienaGOF} function.


Missing tie values and structurally determined tie values are treated
in the estimation in such a way that they do not contribute directly
to the target statistics. This behavior is mirrored in their treatment
in \textsf{sienaGOF}. The aim is that such values do not contribute
to any differences between observed and simulated values.

Tie variables that are missing at either the beginning or the end of the period
are replaced by 0, both in the observed and in the simulated networks.
For behavioral variables they are replaced by missings (\texttt{NA}).

If there are any differences between structural values at the beginning and
at the end of a period, these are dealt with as follows.
For tie variables that have a structural value at the start of the period,
this value replaces the observed value at the end of the period
(for the goodness of fit assessment only).
For tie variables that have a structural value at the end of the period
but a free value value at the start of the period, the reference value for
the simulated values is lacking; therefore, the simulated values at the end
of the period then are replaced by the structural value at the end of the period
(again, for the goodness of fit assessment only).

\section{Estimation}
\label{S_Est}

The model parameters are estimated under the specification given
during the model specification part, using an iterative stochastic
approximation algorithm.
Four estimation procedures are implemented:
the Method of Moments \citep*[`MoM';][]{Snijders01, SnijdersEA07};
the Generalized Method of Moments \citep*[`GMoM';][]{ASS2015,ASS2019};
 the Method of Maximum Likelihood \citep[`ML';][]{SnijdersEA10a};
 and a Bayesian method
 \citep{Koskinen04, KoskinenSnijders07,SchweinbergerSnijders07c}.
 For non-constant rate functions, currently only
 MoM and GMoM estimation is available.
 The Method of Moments is the default;
 ML and Bayesian estimation methods require much more computing time.
 Given the greater efficiency but longer required computing time
 for the ML and Bayesian methods,
 these can be useful especially for smaller data sets
 and relatively complicated models
 (networks and behavior; creation or endowment effects).

In this chapter, the number of
parameters is denoted by $p$. The algorithm is based on repeated
(and repeated, and repeated...) simulation of the evolution
process of the network. These repetitions are called `runs' in the
following. The MoM estimation algorithm is based on comparing the
observed network (obtained from the data files)
to the hypothetical networks generated in the simulations.

Note that the estimation algorithm is of a stochastic nature, so
the results can vary! This is of course not what you would like.
For well-fitting combinations of data set and model, the
estimation results obtained in different trials will be very
similar. It is good to repeat the estimation process at least once
for the models that are to be reported in papers or presentations,
to confirm that what you report is a stable result of the algorithm.
If you wish to have identical results over different estimations,
you can set the seed; see Section~\ref{S_param}.

\subsection{An overview of the estimation procedure}
\hypertarget{T_S_options}{   }
% provisionally placed here.

The estimation process is implemented in functions \textsf{siena07}
and \sfn{sienacpp} (alternatives for each other),
using an algorithm specification defined in function \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
Estimation starts with initial values for the parameters,
and the functions \textsf{siena07} and \sfn{sienacpp} both return a
so-called \textsf{sienaFit} object containing the estimates and their standard errors and
a lot of further information.
Since the estimation procedure is iterative (i.e., depending on the
initial value) and stochastic,
the results are not always completely satisfactory. We shall see below
how the satisfactory convergence of the algorithm can be checked,
and how to go on if this is not satisfactory.




Much of what follows is about the use of \sfn{siena07}
but applies equally to \sfn{sienacpp}.
The difference between these two functions is that
estimation by \sfn{sienacpp} stays entirely in the
`back end' \sfn{C++} part of \si, contrasting with \sfn{siena07}
which carries out the simulations in \sfn{C++} but the
Robbins-Monro updates in the \sfn{R} `front end' part;
this yields greater computational efficiency for \sfn{sienacpp}.
Since the simulations take the largest amount of processing time
for medium-sized and large networks, the time difference is
notable, in a proportional sense, mainly for data sets
where simulations run very quickly (i.e., number of actors
and distance between first and last simulations are small).
Further, results from \sfn{sienacpp} cannot used for
\sfn{sienaGOF}.
Note that \sfn{sienacpp} is available only in \sfn{RSienaTest}.

The estimation algorithm is determined by a call of functions
such as
\begin{verbatim}
algorithm1   <- sienaAlgorithmCreate(projname = "trypro")
results1     <- siena07(algorithm1, data = mydata, effects = myeff)
\end{verbatim}
The function \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate} defines an algorithm specification
object with options for the algorithm, and the function  \textsf{siena07}
carries out the estimation.
If you do not want to see the graphical interface with intermediate
results, or if your computer has problems showing this, then add
the option \texttt{batch = TRUE}, as in
\begin{verbatim}
results1  <- siena07(algorithm1, data = mydata, effects = myeff,
                      batch = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
If you wish to have detailed information at the console about the intermediate
steps taken by the algorithm, then add
the option \texttt{verbose = TRUE}, as in
\begin{verbatim}
results1  <- siena07(algorithm1, data = mydata, effects = myeff,
                      verbose = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Parameters of the algorithm}
\label{S_param}

Function \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate} defines the algorithm.
The algorithm is described more in detail in Section~\ref{S_algorithm}.
This function has a lot of parameters that you will never need to touch,
and which have been put there for the purpose of investigating
the best settings of the algorithm.
The following parameters are worth knowing about.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{projname}: the `project name', the root name of the file
       to which relevant intermediate and final information will be written.
       This file will be put in the working directory of your R session,
       and have the name \texttt{ppp.txt}, if \texttt{projname~=~ppp}.
       (In \RS versions before 1.2-23, this file was called \texttt{ppp.out}).
  \item \texttt{n3}: the number of iterations in the third phase of the estimation
       algorithm, determining the precision of the standard errors.
  \item \texttt{seed}: the seed of the random number algorithm. This seed determines
       the starting value of the random number algorithm, and thereby leads
       to exactly reproducible results. Normally, if the estimation procedure
       has converged as indicated by the convergence criterion (see the next section) and
       parameter \texttt{n3} is large enough, different random seeds will give
       results for converged models that are equivalent for practical purposes.
       (Well, this is a way to check
       whether indeed your convergence criterion is strict enough, and whether
       parameter \texttt{n3} is large enough.)
\end{enumerate}
Then there are some parameters that determine some aspects of the
model, rather than the estimation algorithm. These are the following.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item \texttt{modelType}: the type of model for non-directed networks,
        see Section~\ref{S_modeltype_nd}.
  \item \texttt{behModelType}: the type of model defining the behavior
        ministeps at the boundary (minimum and maximum) of the range,
        see Section~\ref{S_modeltype_beh}.
  \item \texttt{MaxDegree}: puts a maximum to the outdegree of all actors,
        see Section~\ref{S_maxdegree}.
  \item \texttt{Offset}: an offset is a constant added to the
        constant term in a generalized linear model, it is used for
         \texttt{modelType~=~3}, see Section~\ref{S_modeltype_nd}.
\end{enumerate}
Some other parameters are sometimes important, in the case of convergence
difficulties.  Their role is described in the following sections.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item \texttt{useStdInits}: whether the initial values in the effects
    object will be ignored and default values used instead (default: \texttt{FALSE}).
  \item \texttt{nsub}:  the number of subphases in the estimation algorithm
    (default: 4).
  \item \texttt{n2start}: the number of iterations in the first subphase.
  \item \texttt{firstg}: the initial value of the multiplier for the size in the
       stochastic approximation algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
The default estimation algorithm is the Method of Moments. But it is also possible
to use the method of Maximum Likelihood; further explanations are in Section~\ref{S_ML}.
This is determined by the following parameters.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item \texttt{maxlike}: whether to use Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation
       (default: \texttt{FALSE}).
  \item \texttt{mult}: the multiplication factor for the ML algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
As described in Section~\ref{S_cond}, there is a choice between conditional
and non-conditional estimation. Conditioning means that for one of the
dependent variables, the simulated number of differences is always equal to
the observed number of differences (note that the number of ministeps usually will
be somewhat larger than the number of differences, because some ministeps
may cancel earlier ministeps, and ministeps can have the outcome of
`no change'). The associated parameters are
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item \texttt{cond}: whether to use conditional estimation;
  \item \texttt{condvarno}: the number of the conditioning variable;
  \item \texttt{condname}: the name of the conditioning variable (an alternative
      to using \texttt{condvarno}).
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, there are some parameters with special purposes that sometimes
can be used.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item \texttt{simOnly}: to indicate that the interest is in simulation,
       not estimation; see Chapter~\ref{S_sim}.
  \item \texttt{lessMem}: using \texttt{lessMem = TRUE} reduces storage in
      the \texttt{sienaFit} object produced by \textsf{siena07} by leaving out
      some large arrays; but these are used by functions
     \textsf{sienaTimeTest} and \textsf{sienaGOF}, so running those functions will be impossible
     for \sfn{sienaFit} object obtained with \texttt{lessMem = TRUE}.
\end{enumerate}
Finally, there is a parameter for which the default is always good;
but you might try it out anyway.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item \texttt{dolby}: the default is \texttt{TRUE}, which implies that the
   statistics are regressed on the augmented data score, which is known to have
   expected value 0. This is explained in \citet{Snijders2013Greenwich}.
   This yields a considerable reduction of the variance of the statistics
   without affecting their expected values.\\
   The regression coefficients are calculated in Phase~1.
   If \texttt{prevAns = ans} is used
   and the model has remained identical, the regression coefficients from
   Phase~3 of \texttt{ans} are used.
   These values are given in \texttt{ans\$regrCoef};
   the corresponding correlations are in \texttt{ans\$regrCor}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results of the estimation}

The estimation produces an output file in the current working directory,
of which the name is defined by the \textsf{projname} option;
in this example, the name is \texttt{trypro.txt}.
To look at the information, you may either look at this file
(which can be opened by any text editor), or produce results on the \R console.

A brief summary of the results is given in the \R console by
typing the name of the  \sfn{sienaFit} object. For example,
if this name is \texttt{results1},
\begin{verbatim}
results1
\end{verbatim}
could give a summary such as
% see sim_script.R; these are the s50 data, waves 1-2, seed=1234.

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\bigskip

\emph{Convergence check}
\smallskip

\noindent
The column \texttt{\small Convergence t-ratio} shown above, also
called \texttt{\small t statistics for deviations from targets},
is an indicator of convergence. If some of these values
are higher in absolute value than 0.1, convergence is not adequate.
The value \texttt{Overall maximum convergence ratio} is another, stricter,
indicator of convergence.
For adequate convergence, this value should be less than 0.25.
The overall maximum convergence ratio for \sfn{sienaFit} object \texttt{results1}
is given by  \texttt{results1\$tconv.max}.

In this example, convergence is good.
If convergence is not adequate, the estimation must be repeated.
Usually the best way to do this is by employing the
argument \texttt{prevAns} in the call of \sfn{siena07}.
Given that the earlier result was already called \texttt{results1},
this is done, e.g., by
\begin{verbatim}
results1  <- siena07(algorithm1, data = mydata, effects = myeff,
                      prevAns = results1)
\end{verbatim}
The practical procedure therefore, in usual cases, is that
one runs \sfn{siena07}, if necessary repeatedly with
subsequent runs using the \texttt{prevAns} parameter as above,
until the \texttt{Overall maximum convergence ratio} is less than 0.25
and all  \texttt{\small convergence t ratios}
are less than 0.1.
(The threshold value of 0.25 is not hewn in stone,
and small deviations are acceptable.)

In some cases this aim is not easily reached;
what to do then is treated in the following.

\subsubsection{Initial Values}
\label{S_initials}

The \emph{initial values} can be given in three ways.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The default: if \texttt{useStdInits = FALSE} and no \textsf{prevAns}
      parameter is given in the call of \textsf{siena07},
      the initial values are taken from the \textsf{sienaEffects} object,
      in this example called \texttt{myeff}.\\
      Requesting
\begin{verbatim}
myeff
\end{verbatim}
      will show the initial values.
      As long as no time dummies have been requested
      using \textsf{sienaTimeFix}, the initial values for the requested
      effects are in the vector
\begin{verbatim}
myeff$initialValue[myeff$include]
\end{verbatim}
      Changing these values is not often necessary, because the
      parameter \textsf{prevAns}, as explained in the next item,
      does this behind the scenes.\\
       If one does wish to change the initial values contained in
      the effects object, this can be done using the
      function \textsf{updateTheta}, which copies the
      estimates from earlier results, contained in a
      \sfn{sienaFit} object, to the effects object.
      For a single effect the initial value can be changed
      by the \textsf{setEffect}
      function in which the \textsf{initialValue} then must be set.
\item If \texttt{useStdInits = FALSE} and the \textsf{prevAns}
      (`previous answer')
      parameter is used, such as in
      \begin{verbatim}
results1 <-siena07(algorithm1, data = mydata, effects = myeff,
                    prevAns = results0)
      \end{verbatim}
      the initial parameter estimates are taken from the results of
      what is given as the
      \textsf{prevAns} parameter. This must be a
      \textsf{sienaFit} object; in this example it is given as
      \texttt{results0}.\\
      If the specification of the effects object used to obtain
      \texttt{results0} was the same as \texttt{myeff}, then not only the initial
      values are copied, but also Phase~1 of the algorithm is skipped,
      because information for the sensitivity of the statistics with
      respect to the parameters is taken from the results of Phase~3
      of \texttt{results0}.\\
      If the specification of the effects object used to obtain
      \texttt{results0} was not the same as \texttt{myeff}, then for those
      parameters that do match, the initial values are copied
      from \texttt{results0} and Phase~1 is carried out as usual.
\item If \texttt{useStdInits = TRUE} is used in the call of
      \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}, standard initial values are used.\\
      These consist of some reasonable values for the rate parameters and the
      outdegree parameter, as well as for the linear shape parameter
      for behavioral dependent variables (if any);
      and 0 parameters for the rest.\\
      The default is  \texttt{useStdInits = FALSE}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Convergence Check}
\label{S_ccheck}

When parameters have been estimated, first the
\hypertarget{T_convergence}{convergence} of the
algorithm must be checked. This is done by looking at the
\emph{$t$-ratios for convergence} and the
\emph{overall maximum convergence ratio}.
These are given in the output of the algorithm, presented above.
This check
considers the deviations between simulated values
(in Phase~3, see below) of the
statistics and their observed values (the latter are called the
`targets'). Ideally, these deviations should be 0. Because of the
stochastic nature of the algorithm, when the process has properly
converged the deviations are small but not exactly equal to 0.
The program calculates the averages and standard deviations of the
deviations and combines these in a $t$-ratio (in this case,
average divided by standard deviation).
The overall maximum convergence ratio is the maximum value of
the ratio
\[
 \frac{\text{average deviation}}{\text{standard deviation}}
\]
for any linear combination of the target values.
A precise definition is given in \\
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}
which can be downloaded from the \SI website.
The overall maximum convergence ratio for \sfn{sienaFit} object \texttt{results1}
is given by  \texttt{results1\$tconv.max}.

Convergence is excellent when the overall maximum convergence ratio
is less than 0.2, and for all the individual parameters the $t$-ratios
for convergence all are less than 0.1 in absolute value;
convergence is reasonable when the former is less than 0.30.
For published results, it is suggested that estimates presented come from runs
in which the overall maximum convergence ratio is less than 0.25.
(These bounds are indications only, and are not meant as severe limitations.)

In the example above, the largest absolute value of the $t$-ratios for convergence
is equal to 0.0427, and the overall maximum convergence ratio is 0.1608;
both are quite good values.

If convergence is not adequate, the best way to continue
is by making another estimation run,
now carrying on from the last obtained result. This is done by
using this result in the \textsf{prevAns} (`previous answer')
parameter, while taking care that  \texttt{useStdInits = FALSE}
has been specified (but this is the default). An example is
\begin{verbatim}
results1 <-siena07(algorithm1, data = mydata, effects = myeff,
                    prevAns = results1)
\end{verbatim}
In this case, this second estimation run produced good results, with a
maximum absolute   $t$-ratio for convergence equal to 0.0777.
The output file gives more extensive results, viz.,
 the averages and standard deviations of the
deviations from targets and the resulting $t$-ratios:

from the target value was 0.5380, and the standard deviation across the
1000 simulations in Phase~3 was  14.5726. This yields a $t$-ratio
of $ 0.5380 / 14.5726 = 0.0369$.
Large values of the averages and standard deviations are
in themselves not at all a reason for concern; only the
$t$-ratio is important.

\subsubsection{Continued estimation to obtain convergence}
\label{S_contconv}

Above, the \sfn{prevAns} parameter was mentioned which will
lead to using the result from a previous estimation as the initial
value for the next estimation.
If convergence is difficult to obtain, one may use other
settings of the estimation algorithm, given as
parameters in the \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} function, to try and
improve convergence.
The main parameters of \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} that can be used
for this purpose are the following.
They are briefly explained in the help file for this function.
For the technical background, see
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}
which can be downloaded from the \SI website.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{n2start}\\
    This is the minimum length of Phase~2.1, i.e., the first subphase of phase~2.
    The default value
     is $2.52\times (p+7)$, where $p$ is the number of estimated parameters,
     divided by \texttt{nbrNodes}, if multiple processes are used.
    The minimum lengths of the subsequent subphases\footnote{These values are
     meant to approximate $(7+p)\times 2^{4(k+2)/3}$.
    With the stepwise gain parameter $a_N$ being halved
    for each new subphase, these values
    imply that $a_N$ is asymptotically of order $N^{-3/4}$, which is
    good for convergence of the algorithm.}
    are $(2.52)^{k-1} \times\,$\texttt{n2start} for subphase~$k$.\\
    This implies the total duration of the algorithm will be roughly proportional to
    \texttt{n2start}. One may try using a value higher than the default.
\item \texttt{nsub}\\
    This is the number of subphases in Phase~2 of the algorithm.
    Usually, the default value of 4 is large enough. Below it is mentioned
    that sometimes it can be good to use \texttt{nsub~=~1} in conjunction
    with a large value of \texttt{n2start} to improve convergence
    after having found a reasonably good, but not totally satisfactory,
    estimate.
\item \texttt{firstg}\\
    This determines the step sizes in the estimation algorithm. If the algorithm is unstable,
    use a smaller value (but greater than~0).
    The default value is 0.2.
    Sometimes for difficult data-model combinations, the algorithm
    diverges very quickly, and this may be countered by smaller values of
     \texttt{firstg}, e.g., 0.01 or 0.05.
\item \texttt{diagonalize}\\
    This parameter may range from 0 to 1,
    and determines the extent to which the matrix of derivatives of expected
    values with respect to parameters is diagonalized.
    The value 1 (total diagonalization) gives greatest stability;
    smaller values give greater efficiency.
    The default for MoM is 0.2.
\item \texttt{doubleAveraging}\\
      This replaces the Robbins-Monro updating step by a double averaging
      step \citep{bather1989,SchwabeWalk96,KushnerYin03} which can be
      more efficient. The default is \texttt{doubleAveraging=0}, which starts using
      this step from subphase 2.1.
\end{itemize}


If convergence is not very good even with repeated estimation with
the \sfn{prevAns} option, sometimes it can be useful to try and use
\sfn{updateTheta} to copy the results from the earlier estimation
rather than \sfn{prevAns}; this will use the same starting values
but not skip Phase~1 of the estimation algorithm, and sometimes
this turns out to lead to faster convergence.
\medskip

The following function will
iterate the execution of \sfn{siena07} until it has converged.
It can be modified to suit your further purposes.
The argument \texttt{ans0} can be employed to use an earlier existing
`on track' estimation result, if available, as the initial value
for the algorithm.

\begin{verbatim}
siena07ToConvergence <- function(alg, dat, eff, ans0 = NULL, ...){
   numr <- 0
   ans <- siena07(alg, data = dat, effects = eff, prevAns = ans0, ...) # the first run
   repeat {
       save(ans, file = paste("ans",numr,".RData",sep = "")) # to be safe
       numr <- numr + 1         # count number of repeated runs
       tm <- ans$tconv.max      # convergence indicator
       cat(numr, tm,"\n")       # report how far we are
       if (tm < 0.25) {break}   # success
       if (tm > 10) {break}     # divergence without much hope
                                # of returning to good parameter values
       if (numr > 30) {break}   # now it has lasted too long
       ans <- siena07(alg, data = dat, effects = eff, prevAns = ans, ...)
       }
   if (tm > 0.25)
   {
      cat("Warning: convergence inadequate.\n")
   }
   ans
}
\end{verbatim}

Another approach that sometimes can be helpful to obtain convergence in difficult
situations is to gradually build up the model, adding further effects
while using the \sfn{prevAns} parameter to use previous estimates as starting
values for the next, extended model. This may be more successful than
estimating a complicated model right from the start.

When there are difficulties in obtaining convergence, note that one also
should reconsider the model specification; good specification of the model often
considerably improves the converge of the parameter estimation.
When reading the words here because of a concern about convergence,
please read on at least until and including Section~\ref{S_conv}.

\subsection{Use of the algorithm parameters}

The parameters mentioned in the preceding section can be used in the following way
to try and achieve convergence if one does not obtain the desired low level
of \sfn{tconv.max} by successive estimation using the \sfn{prevAns}
parameter sequentially.
The advice is to use (1.) \underline{or} (2.), in both cases together with (3.).
It is to be expected that (1.) will be computationally more efficient than (2.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item First do an estimation with the default parameters
    for the algorithm.
    If that has returned a somewhat reasonable provisional estimate
    (among other requirements, with a value of \sfn{tconv.max} that is
    not very high; and \emph{not} with one or more parameter estimates
    being very high in absolute value), continue the estimation, using \sfn{prevAns},
    with \sfn{nsub=1}; a high value for \sfn{n3}, e.g., 3000 or 5000;
    and a high value for \sfn{n2start}.
    What is `a high value for \sfn{n2start}' depends on the data set
    - model combination,
    the number of parameters in the first place;
    and the number of processes used.
    The baseline value (see the preceding section\footnote{The value given here
    is the default number of simulation runs in the 4'th subphase.})
    would be \\
    $(p+7)\times (2.52)^4 / \sfn{nbrNodes}$ \\
    where $p$ is the
    number of estimated parameters (excluding the rate parameters
    estimated by conditioning, if conditional estimation is used).
    For a `high value', start with a value that is about twice as large,
    Note that computation time in Phase~2 will be proportional to \sfn{n2start}.
    Continue estimation with these algorithmic parameters using \sfn{prevAns},
    further perhaps increasing \sfn{n2start} if necessary.

    If estimation further was unstable, a possibility here is to
    use a value for \sfn{firstg} clearly less than the default 0.2; e.g., 0.01.
    But often the default works just fine here.
\item As an alternative to (1.): in estimations where \sfn{prevAns} is
    not\footnote{Until December 2, 2019, unfortunately, the `not'
    was erroneously omitted here.} used,
    use more than 4 subphases: \sfn{nsub=5} or, if that is not sufficient,
    \sfn{nsub=6}.\\
    Note that if \sfn{prevAns} is used, a larger value of \sfn{nsub}
    makes no sense; if anything, \sfn{nsub} should be decreased
    (and \sfn{n2start} increased).
\item Use for \sfn{n3} a larger value than the default.
    E.g., \sfn{n3 = 3000} or \sfn{5000};
    if it was necessary to further increase \sfn{nsub} or \sfn{n2start}, it may also be
    necessary to further increase \sfn{n3}.
\end{enumerate}

All these choices clearly increase computing time; but less so, and with
more likely success, than just carrying on very long with \sfn{siena07ToConvergence}
using the default algorithmic parameters.



\subsection{What to do if there are convergence problems}
\label{S_conv}

If there are persisting convergence problems even after repeated estimations
using the \texttt{prevAns} parameter and trying out various
settings for the algorithm as suggested in the preceding sections,
this may have several reasons.
\begin{itemize}
\item The data specification was incorrect (e.g., because the coding
      was not given properly).
\item The starting values were poor.
      Try restarting from the standard initial values
      (a certain non-zero value for the
      density parameter, and zero values for the other parameters);
      or from values obtained as the estimates for a simpler model
      that gave no problems.
      The initial default parameter values can be obtained
      by choosing the algorithm option `standard initial values".
\iffalse
      When starting estimations with Model Type 2
      (see Section~\ref{S_modeltype}), there may be some problems to
      find suitable starting values.
      For Model Type 2, it is advised to start with
      \hyperlink{T_S_cond}{unconditional estimation}
      and a simple model,
      and to turn back to conditional estimation, using the current parameter
      values as initial estimates for new estimation runs, only when
      satisfactory estimates for a simple model have been found.
\fi
\item The model does not fit well in the sense that even with well-chosen
      parameters it will not give a good representation of the data.

      This can be the case, e.g., when there is a large heterogeneity
      between the actors which is not well represented by effects
      of covariates.
      The out-degrees and in-degrees are given in the begin of the \RS output
      to be able to check whether there are outlying actors having very high
      in- or out-degrees, or a deviating dynamics in their degrees.
      Strong heterogeneity between the actors will have to be
      represented by suitable covariates; if these are not available,
      one may define one or a few dummy variables each representing
      an outlying actor, and give this dummy variable an ego effect
      in the case of deviant out-degrees, and an alter effect in the
      case of deviant in-degrees.

      Sometimes transitivity can better be modeled by the GWESP effects
      (search for this term in the manual) than by transitive triplers.
      This may help with convergence.

      For modeling large networks, it is important to represent
      meeting opportunities, e.g., by a suitable dyadic covariate,
      or by the \texttt{sameX} effect of a suitable categorical covariate.

      Sometimes there are important differences between the actors in how many
      changes they make in their outgoing ties. This should then
      be reflected by including one or more rate effects.
      The experience is that the main rate effect to include
      is the rate effect of the outdegrees (\texttt{outRate},
      see Section~\ref{S_r}).

      Another possibility is that there is time heterogeneity.
      Indications about this can be gathered also from the descriptives
      given in the start of the output file produced by \sfn{print01Report}:
      the number of changes
      upward and downward, in the network and also -- if any -- in the
      dependent behavioral variable. If these do not show a smooth
      or similar pattern across the observations, then it may be useful
      to include actor variables representing time trends. These
      could be smooth -- e.g., linear -- but they also could be dummy variables
      representing one or more observational periods; these must be included
      as an ego effect to represent time trends in the tendency to make ties
      (or to display higher values of the behavior in question).
      Further see Section~\ref{S_timetest1} for how to discover and handle
      time heterogeneity.
\item Too many weak effects are included. Use a smaller number of effects,
      delete non-significant ones, and increase complexity step by step.
      Retain parameter estimates from the last
      (simpler) model as the initial values for the new estimation procedure,
      provided for this model the algorithm converged
      without difficulties; here also \texttt{prevAns} may be used.\\
      Effects that are left out of the estimation can still be
      used in the model by specifying them with \texttt{test=TRUE, fix=TRUE};
      this will not burden the estimation process, and give information
      (with a score-type test, see Section~\ref{S_Scoretest})
      about the significance of this excluded effect.\\
      Usually this will be applied with \texttt{initialValue=0}, the default.
      But sometimes it may be done with a plausible non-zero value for
      \texttt{initialValue}.
\item Two or more effects are included that are almost collinear
      in the sense that they can both explain the same observed structures.
      This will be seen in high absolute values of
      correlations between parameter estimates, presented in the
      \textsf{summary} of the results object and also in the output file.
      In this case it may be better to exclude one of these effects from the model.
\item An effect is included that is large but of which the precise
      value is not well-determined (see above:
      \hyperlink{T_fix}{section on fixing parameters}).
      This will be seen in estimates and standard errors both being large
      and often in divergence of the algorithm.
      Fix this parameter to some large value.
      (Note: large here means, e.g., more than 5 or less than -5; depending
      on the effect, of course.)
\end{itemize}

Another trick that may be tried is the following.
Sometimes one (or some) of the rate parameters are especially the causes of
difficulties of convergence.
Then one may fix this parameter at a good value, and estimate the rest
of the parameters. Suppose that this is feasible, i.e., good convergence can be
obtained provided that this rate parameter is fixed. Then by trial and error
one may find a fixed value for this rate parameter for which the $t$-ratio for
convergence for this parameter also is acceptable
(less than 0.2, preferably less than 0.1).
Since normally, rate parameters are nuisance parameters (i.e., not of focal interest),
this can be an acceptable way out.



\subsection{Some important components of the \textsf{sienaFit} object}
\label{S_fitcomp}

If a user would like to do further calculations, it can be
useful to know about the following components of  \textsf{sienaFit} objects.
Suppose the object is called \texttt{ans}. Some of the components
are the following.
Further details are in the help file for \textsf{siena07}.

\begin{tabbing}

                                                       for conditioning;\\
                                      \> if time dummies were requested using
                                            \textsf{sienaTimeFix},\\
                                      \> these are also in \texttt{theta}) \\

                                        in the call of \textsf{siena07}; \\
                             \> in case of Maximum Likelihood estimation (see Section~\ref{S_sims}), note that \\
                             \> for observed tie variables the simulated values are
                             equal to the observed; \\
                             \> for missing tie variables, the simulated values can be regarded \\
                             \> as model-based imputations \\

 \texttt{ans\$x }            \> the algorithm object used\\
 \texttt{ans\$f }            \> everything needed for the calculations in C++;\\
                             \> in particular, the data set is hidden in here,
                                and can be reconstructed.\\
                             \> Digging in will show as \texttt{mat1} the network data,
                                 as \texttt{mat2} the missings, \\
                             \>   and as \texttt{mat3} the structurally determined values.\\
                             \> All these are stored as transposed edge lists.\\
                             \> Programmers can consult function \texttt{initializeFRAN}\\
                             \> for the creation and hence contents of this object.\\
 \texttt{ans\$version }      \> the \textsf{RSiena/Test} version\\
 \texttt{ans\$startingDate}  \> date and time of the start of the estimation (since version 1.2-17).\\

\end{tabbing}
Like for any \R object, the internal structure of the \textsf{sienaFit} object
can be requested by requesting
\begin{verbatim}
sink("ans.txt")
str(ans)
sink()
\end{verbatim}
This writes the structure to the external file \texttt{ans.txt}, which may
be better than printing it to the console, because it is a long story.\\
A limited representation of the structure of this object is obtained from
\begin{verbatim}
sink("ans.txt")
str(ans, 1)
sink()
\end{verbatim}

To get some further understanding, one could investigate some of the components
of this object as follows.
Note that putting a statement between parentheses like in\\
\texttt{(A <- B)} is just a way for
constructing the object \texttt{A} and showing it at the same time.
\begin{verbatim}
# Compute the covariance matrix of the generated statistics
print(covsf <- cov(ans$sf))
# This is the same as ans$msf, provided there are no fixed parameters.
# The means and standard deviations of the generated statistics minus targets:
(v <- colMeans(ans$sf))
(s <- apply(ans$sf, 2, sd))
# This also allows to compute the convergence t-ratios
v / s
# To get the generated statistics without subtracting the targets,
# we have to add the targets.
# To do this, repeated transposition t can be used:
stats <- t(t(ans$sf) + ans$targets)
# or
stats <- ans$sf + rep(ans$targets, each = nrow(ans$sf))
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{tconv} components are used
in the function \textsf{siena07ToConvergence}
presented above.

\subsection{Algorithm}
\label{S_algorithm}

The estimation algorithm is an implementation of a procedure of which
the original version was proposed by \citet{RobbinsMonro51}.
The algorithm is
described in \citet{Snijders01, Snijders05}
and in
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}
which can be downloaded from the \SI website.
It has %for both the MoM and ML method
three phases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In Phase~1, the parameter vector is held constant at its
initial value.
      This phase is for
      having a first rough estimate of the matrix of derivatives.
\item Phase~2 consists of several subphases.
      More subphases means a greater precision. The default
      number of subphases is 4.\\
      Each subphase consists of a large number of runs, usually hundreds of them.
      Each run consists of a simulation of the network dynamics over all periods,
      using trial parameter values. From this simulation, the estimation statistics
      are calculated;
      the devations between the generated statistics and the observed values,
      which are the target values, are used to update the trial parameter values.
      For statistics of which the outcome is too high the corresponding
      parameter will be decreased, if it is too low the parameter will be increased.
      These changes in the parameter values are smaller in the later subphases.\\
      If the option \texttt{dolby} is in force, the statistics are regressed
      on the score function of the augmented data.
      This reduces their variance without affecting their expected value,
      see \citet{Snijders2013Greenwich}.\\
      The program searches for parameter values where these deviations
      average out to 0. This is reflected by what is called the
      \hypertarget{T_quasiac}{`quasi-auto\-cor\-relations'}
      in the output screen.
      These are averages
      of products of successively generated deviations between
      generated and observed statistics. It is a good sign
      for the convergence of the process when the
      \hyperlink{T_quasiac}{quasi-auto\-correlations}
      are negative (or positive but close to 0),
      because this means the generated values are jumping
      around the observed values.
      When estimating by the Method of Moments, it is usual for the
      quasi-auto\-correlations to become close to 0.
      For estimation by Maximum Likelihood, they will usually
      eventually tend to fluctuate about some positive values
      determined by the multiplication factor (see Section~\ref{S_ML}).
      Large quasi-auto\-correlations (larger than .5), when using the Method of
      Maximum Likelihood, suggest that either the estimation process
      is still far from its eventual limit (the final estimate), \underline{or}
      the multiplication factor may be too small.
      But in this case, the auto\-correlations given in the output file
      are more important information than those given on the screen.
\item In Phase~3, the parameter vector is held constant again,
      now at its final value.
      This phase is for estimating the covariance matrix and the
      matrix of derivatives used for the computation of standard errors.\\
      The number of runs in Phase~3 is given by parameter \texttt{n3},
      with the default value of 1000.
      For precise estimation of standard errors, higher values of \texttt{n3}
      are desirable. This requires a lot
      of computing time, but when the number of Phase~3 runs is too low,
      the standard errors computed are rather unreliable.
\end{enumerate}

The number of subphases in Phase~2, and the number of runs in
Phase~3, are determined by parameters \textsf{nsub} and \textsf{n3}
in the call of \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.

During the estimation process, if the graphical user interface
is used (the default \\
\texttt{batch = FALSE} in the call of \textsf{siena07}),
the user can break in and modify the estimation process in two
ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item it is possible to terminate the estimation;
\item in Phase~2, it is possible to terminate Phase~2
      and continue with Phase~3.
\end{enumerate}

% For the ML estimation option and for the non-longitudinal case,
% tuning the `multiplication factor' and the `initial gain parameter'
% can be important for getting good results;
% for Bayesian estimation the `multiplicaton factor' can likewise
% be important; this is briefly described in Section~\ref{S_exec}.


\subsection{Output}
\label{S_output}

Output can be obtained in several ways.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item On the \R console.\\
        When the \textsf{sienaFit} object produced by \textsf{siena07}
        is called \texttt{ans},
        requesting just \texttt{ans} or \texttt{print(ans)}
        produces output on the \R console. The function
        \texttt{summary(ans)} produces more extensive output.
  \item A table in latex or html format can be produced by the
        \textsf{xtable.sienaFit} method.
        For example,
        \begin{verbatim}
        xtable(ans, file = "ans1.htm", type = "html")
        \end{verbatim}
        produces in the working directory a html file with the \texttt{ans}
        results in
        tabular form. The \textsf{xtable} package has many further options.\\
  \item The function \textsf{siena.table}
        is available which serves a similar purpose,
        but not using \textsf{xtable}.
        This function writes the table to a file;
        the default file name of the table produced is the name of the
        \sfn{sienaFit} object.
        The choice between \textsf{xtable.sienaFit} and \textsf{siena.table}
        depends on the preference for the tables produced.

        For importing the results of \sfn{xtable} or \textsf{siena.table} into
        MS-Word, the following steps can be used.

        Request \texttt{siena.table(ans)} for some \sfn{sienaFit} object,
        called \texttt{ans} in this example. This will produce,
        under the default settings, the file \texttt{ans.htm} in the current
        working directory.
        Copy-paste this into the MS-Word file.
        In MS-Word then select this table, but
        only the lines of the header and the parameters, not any
        preceding blank line nor the footnote.
        In the MS-Word menu choose `Insert –- Convert text to table -–
        Autofit to contents'.
        This will produce the table in your MS-Word file.
        You can then further modify the table; e.g., change the double minus
        sign \texttt{--} to the MS-Word minus sign $ - $
        (available under `insert -– symbol') and replace the dots for the
        `t stat.' of the rate parameters by blanks.

  \item The function \textsf{siena07}
        writes an output file which is an ASCII (`text') file that can be
        read by any text editor.
        It is called \textsf{\textsl{pname}.txt},
        where \textsf{\textsl{pname}} is the name
        specified in the call of \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.

        This output file is divided into sections
        indicated by a line {\tt @1},
        subsections indicated by a line {\tt @2}, subsubsections indicated
        by {\tt @3}, etc. For getting the main structure of the output, it
        is convenient to have a look at the {\tt @1} marks first.
\end{enumerate}

The primary information in the output of the estimation process
consists of the following three parts.

\subsubsection{Convergence check}

This was discussed in Section~\ref{S_ccheck} \hyperlink{T_convergence}{above}.
\medskip

\subsubsection{Parameter values and standard errors}

The next crucial part of the output is the list of estimates and
standard errors. Suppose that the
following result was obtained on the \R console.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
                              Estimate   Standard   Convergence
                                           Error      t-ratio
Rate parameters:
  0       Rate parameter       6.0742  ( 1.0134   )
  1. eval outdegree (density) -2.5341  ( 0.1445   )   0.0571
  2. eval reciprocity          2.1106  ( 0.2625   )   0.0710
  3. eval transitive triplets  0.5449  ( 0.1781   )   0.0584
  4. eval 3-cycles             0.0779  ( 0.3425   )   0.0777
  5. eval smoke1 similarity    0.4519  ( 0.2497   )   0.0400
\end{verbatim}
}

The rate parameter is the parameter called $ \rho^{\rm net}_m$
in Section~\ref{S_r} below (where $m=1$ because there is only one period).
The value 6.0742 indicates
that the estimated number of opportunities
for change per actor (note that each actor
corresponds to a row in the adjacency matrix)
between the two observations is
6.07 (rounded in view of the standard error 1.01). Note that this
refers to unobserved changes, and that some
opportunities for change lead to the decision `no change',
and moreover some of these changes may
cancel (make a new choice and then withdraw it again), so the
average observed number of differences per actor will be
smaller than this estimated number of unobserved changes.

The other five parameters are the weights in the \emph{evaluation function}.
The terms in the evaluation function in this model specification are
the \hyperlink{T_density}{out-degree effect} defined as $s_{i1}$ in
Section \ref{S_f}, the
\hyperlink{T_reci}{reciprocity effect} $s_{i2}$,
\hyperlink{T_transtrip}{transitive triplets effect} $s_{i3}$,
\hyperlink{T_cycle3}{three-cycles effect} $s_{i5}$,
\hyperlink{T_simx}{sex similarity effect} $s_{i\ref{simx}}$.
Therefore the
estimated evaluation function here is
\[
\,- 2.53 \, s_{i1}(x) \+ 2.11\, s_{i2}(x) \+ 0.54 \, s_{i3}(x)\+ 0.08 \, s_{i5}(x)\+ 0.45 \, s_{i\ref{simx}}(x)
\]
where again some rounding was applied in view of the standard errors.
The parameter estimates can be combined with
the standard errors to test the parameters.
(Testing of parameters is discussed more extensively
in Chapter~\ref{S_test}.)

 For the rate
parameter, testing the hypothesis that it is 0 is meaningless
because the fact that there are differences between the two observed
networks implies that the rate of change must be positive. The
weights in the evaluation function can be tested by $t$-statistics,
defined as estimate divided by its standard error. (Do not confuse
this $t$-test with \hyperlink{T_convergence}{the $t$-ratio for}
checking convergence; these are completely different although both
are $t$ ratios!) Here the $t$-values are, respectively,
 -2.5341/0.1445 = --17.54,
  2.1106/0.2625 = 8.04,
  0.5449/0.1781 = 3.06,
  0.0779/0.3425 = 0.23,
  0.4519/0.2497 = 1.81.
 Since the first three are larger than 2 in absolute value, they are
significant at the 0.05 significance level. It follows that there is
evidence that the actors have a `preference' for reciprocal
and transitive relations.
For thee-cycles, the effect is not significant ($t = 0.23$),
for smoking similarity it is significant at the 0.10 significance level.
The value of the density parameter is not very important; it is
important that this parameter is included to control for the density
in the network, but as all other statistics are correlated with the
density, the density is difficult to interpret by itself.

\subsubsection{Collinearity check}
\label{S_collinear}

In the output file, the covariance matrix
of the estimates is presented.
This can also be requested by \texttt{summary(ans)}.
For conditional estimation, the rate parameters of the dependent variables
used for conditioning are not included in this matrix.
In this case the covariance matrix is as follows.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
Covariance matrix of estimates (correlations below diagonal):)
       0.021       -0.018       -0.010        0.006       -0.008
      -0.468        0.069        0.008       -0.034       -0.002
      -0.395        0.180        0.032       -0.049        0.003
       0.130       -0.378       -0.795        0.117       -0.001
      -0.223       -0.037        0.074       -0.007        0.062
\end{verbatim}
}
The diagonal values are the variances, i.e., the squares of the
standard errors (e.g., for the reciprocity effect,
0.069 is the square of  0.2625). Below the
diagonal are the correlations. E.g., the correlation between the
estimated outdegree effect and the estimated reciprocity effect is
--0.468. These correlations can be used to see whether there is an
important degree of collinearity between the effects. Collinearity
means that several different combinations of parameter values
could represent the same data pattern, in
this case, the same values of the network statistics. When one or
more of the correlations are very close to -1.0 or +1.0, this is a
sign of near collinearity. This will also lead to large standard errors
of those parameters. It may then be advisable to omit one of the
corresponding effects from the model, because it may be redundant
given the other (strongly correlated) effect; but see
\hyperlink{T_collinearity}{below}. It is possible that
the standard error of the retained effect becomes much smaller by
omitting the other effect, which can also mean a change of the
$t$-test from non-significance to significance.

The suggestion of omitting effects that lead to high parameter
correlations with other effect does not directly apply to
effects that should be included for other reasons, such as
the density effect for network dynamics and the linear and
quadratic shape effects for behavior dynamics.

\hypertarget{T_collinearity}{However, correlations between
parameter estimates close to -1.0 or +1.0}
should not be used too soon in themselves as reasons to exclude effects
from a model. This is for two reasons.
In the first place, network statistics often are highly correlated
(for example, total number of ties and number of transitive triplets)
and these correlations just are one of the properties of networks.
Second, near collinearity is not a problem in itself,
but the problem (if any) arises when standard errors are high,
which may occur
because the value of the parameters of highly correlated variables
is very hard to estimate with any precision. The problem resides in the
large standard errors, not in itself in the strong correlation between
the parameter estimates. If for both parameters
the ratio of parameter estimate to standard error,
i.e., the $t$-ratio, is larger than 2 in absolute value,
in spite of the high correlations between the parameter estimates, then
the significance of the $t$-test is evidence anyway that both
effects merit to be included in the model.
In other words, in terms of the `signal-to-noise ratio':
the random noise is high but the signal is strong enough
that it overcomes the noise.

As a rule of thumb for parameter correlations,
usually for correlations of estimated structural network effects there is no
reason for concern even when these correlations
are as strong as .9.

In the example above, the strongest correlation was found between
the parameter estimates for transitive triplets and three-cycles.
This is not surprising, because both are triadic effects.
In this case, the three-cycle effect was not significant,
and can be dropped for that reason.

\subsection{Other estimation procedures}

\RS can estimate models by four estimation methods:
the (unconditional or conditional)
Method of Moments \citep*[`MoM', the default; ][]{Snijders01, SnijdersEA07};
the Generalized Method of Moments \citep*[`GMoM', see][]{ASS2015,ASS2019};
the Maximum Likelihood method \citep*[`ML', see][]{SnijdersEA10a},
and Bayesian methods
\citep[see][]{Koskinen04,KoskinenSnijders07,SchweinbergerSnijders07c,KoskinenSnijders2023}.


Relative to the MoM, the GMoM is theoretically more efficient and somewhat more time-consuming
than the regular MoM since it requires a large number of simulations and
iterations of the model estimation (see Section~\ref{S_GMoM_siena07}).
In models for one network, the MoM and the GMoM yield similar estimates.
However, the GMoM estimator of the parameters of the effects related to the new statistics
is somewhat more efficient than the MoM estimator, especially for the co-evolution model.
When the statistics are informative (i.e., when the number of simultaneous network
and behavioral changes made by the same actor between any two observations is not negligible),
and when the `true model' has only evaluation effects for the GMoM statistics,
the GMoM leads to more accurate estimates with smaller bias
and standard errors than the regular MoM.
This is documented in \citet{ASS2015,ASS2019}.

Comparison among all the four methods indicates that,
in models for one network, without co-evolution,
in nice situations (data sets that are not too small, model specifications
that do not request too much from the data, good fit between data and
model specification), the four methods tend to agree
and there seems to be no reason to use the more time-consuming
ML or Bayesian methods.
For co-evolution models and not-so-nice situations (very small network data sets,
small network and behavior data sets in combination with complex models),
however, GMoM, ML and Bayesian methods tend to produce more accurate results
(i.e., smaller standard errors) than MoM.
Statistical theory suggests that, if the model is well-specified,
GMoM and ML are more efficient estimation methods
than MoM in the sense of producing estimates with smaller standard errors.
But in the `nice situations'
with only one dependent network variable the efficiency advantage of ML is very small.
Bayesian estimation is based on a different statistical paradigm, and
assumes and requires that the uncertainty about parameters is expressed
itself in a probability distribution.

Estimation by the regular Method of Moments (MoM)
and Generalized Method of Moments (GMoM)
is implemented in the functions \sfn{siena07} and \sfn{sienacpp}.
ML estimation is done by the function \sfn{siena07}, using a set of options
created by \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} with \sfn{maxlike = TRUE}.
Bayesian estimation is done by the function \sfn{sienaBayes},
but is as yet implemented only for multilevel network modeling
(Section~\ref{S_sienaBayes}).


\subsection{Generalized Method of Moments estimation}
\label{S_GMoM}

\subsubsection{Using the function \sfn{siena07}}
\label{S_GMoM_siena07}


Compared to the regular Method of Moments (MoM), the Generalized Method of
Moments (GMoM) allows using more statistics than parameters,
thereby exploiting more information in the observed data.
The additional information derives from the use of supplementary statistics,
referred to as GMoM statistics. The GMoM statistics are defined only for the effects
of the evaluation function. Thus, they are used under the assumption that
effects operate in the same strength for the creation and the dissolution of ties,
and the increasing and decreasing of the behavior. In other words,
the creation and the endowment effects
corresponding to the GMoM statistics are assumed to be zero
(see Section~\ref{S_mathmod}).
\medskip

Estimation by the GMoM with the function \sfn{siena07} is obtained
by specifying the GMoM statistics in the effects object using
function \sfn{includeGMoMStatistics},
and setting option \texttt{gmm=TRUE}
in the algorithm object created by the function \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.

Several GMoM statistics have been implemented for the evolution of networks
and for co-evolution of networks and behaviors.

% We denote by $X$ the network, by $Z$ the behavior,
% and by $X(t_m)$ and $Z(t_m)$ the network and the behavior at time $t_m$.
The statistics for the network evolution \citep{ASS2015}
%(\texttt{newrecip}, \texttt{persistrecip}, \texttt{realrecip},
%\texttt{realtrans}, \texttt{agreetrans})
complement the information provided by the regular statistics by
considering two consecutive observations of the network.
%While the regular statistics depend only on the network
%at time $t_m$, i.e., $\sum_{m=2}^M\sum_{i=1}^n S_{ik}(X(t_m))$,
%the GMoM statistics simultaneously consider the networks at time $t_m$ and $t_{m+1}$, i.e.,
%$\sum_{m=2}^M\sum_{i=1}^n S_{ik}(X(t_m),X(t_{m-1}))$.
This formulation allows distinguishing between different antecedents of a same effect.
The implemented statistics are named \texttt{newrecip}, \texttt{persistrecip}, \texttt{realrecip},
\texttt{realtrans}, \texttt{agreetrans}.
The GMoM statistics for the co-evolution of networks and behaviors \citep{ASS2019}
supplement the information of the cross-lagged statistics, depending jointly
on network and behavior, by considering the network and behavior at the same time point.
Thus, the GMoM statistics account for the information on the simultaneous observation
of network and behavioral changes. The name of the implemented GMoM statistics
are \texttt{avSim\_gmm}, \texttt{avAlt\_gmm}, \texttt{totAlt\_gmm}, \texttt{maxAlt\_gmm},
\texttt{minAlt\_gmm}, \texttt{egoX\_gmm}, \texttt{simX\_gmm}.

For the GMoM, the additional statistics used for estimation are specified by
the function \sfn{includeGMoMStatistics}. For example, the following lines
\begin{verbatim}
myeff <- includeGMoMStatistics(myeff, egoX_gmm, interaction1 = "mybeh")
myeff <- includeGMoMStatistics(myeff, simX_gmm, interaction1 = "mybeh")
\end{verbatim}
specify the GMoM statistics for the covariate-related activity and similarity effects.

Although the statistics are added to the effect object,
one should keep in mind that the GMoM statistics are not effects
in the stochastic model, i.e., they are not
included as terms in the objective function.
They are only used for parameter estimation to evaluate the moment conditions.

The distinction between model effects
and GMoM statistics is recalled when printing the effect object in the R console.
As illustrated by the example below, the output is divided into two parts.
The first part lists the model effects.
The second part reports the statistics used for the estimation:
the regular statistics, included by default when an effect is specified
in the probability model using \sfn{includeEffects},
and the GMoM statistics, specified with the function \sfn{includeGMoMStatistics}.
The comparison between the number of effects and that of the statistics
illustrates that, for the GMoM, the one-to-one correspondence
between effects operating for the evolution of networks and/or behaviors,
and statistics operating for parameter estimation is lost.

\normalsize

The computation of the GMoM estimates is more time consuming than that of the regular MoM.
The GMoM estimator is computed by minimizing the distance between the
expected value of the statistics and their sample counterpart.
The minimization demands the computation of a matrix of weights
describing the importance of the statistics and their sensitivity
to the parameters. To estimate the matrix of the GMoM weights, a larger number of simulations
in phase 1 and phase 3 and (at least) one iteration of the function \textsf{siena07} is used.

The following estimation steps are recommended to reach the convergence of the algorithm quickly.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Run the function \textsf{siena07} with one or two sub-phases (i.e.,
\texttt{nsub = 1} or \texttt{nsub = 2}) in phase 2 and a large number of simulations in phase 3
(e.g., \texttt{n3 = 5000}) to get better initial estimates of the model parameters and a
more stable estimation of the matrix of GMoM weights.
 \item Re-estimate the model using the estimates produced in 1 by using four sub-phases in phase 2
(\texttt{nsub = 4}), the same number of simulations in phase 3 (e.g., \texttt{n3 = 5000}) and the
argument \texttt{prevAns = TRUE}.
\end{enumerate}
If convergence is not adequate, one runs \textsf{siena07} repeatedly with \texttt{prevAns = TRUE}.

Difficulties in convergence might occur when the GMoM statistics are `highly' correlated ($>$ 0.9) with the regular statistics. Dropping the corresponding GMoM statistics would solve the problem. Intuitively, when the GMoM and the regular statistics are highly correlated, the GMoM statistics do not carry relevant information
for the estimation of the parameters and can be discarded. Therefore, it is recommended to inspect the covariance matrix of the statistics to decide whether GMoM statistics should be used for the estimation.

We refer to  the  \R script \texttt{GMoMscript.R} on the \SI webpage for an illustration of the GMoM estimation, the steps described above and the inspection of the covariance matrix of the statistics.

Like the MoM, the GMoM allows conditional as well as unconditional estimation (see Section~\ref{S_cond}).


\subsubsection{Using the function \sfn{sienacpp}}
\label{S_GMoM_sienacpp}

Estimation by the Generalized Method of Moments (GMoM) is also implemented
in the function \sfn{sienacpp}, available in \sfn{RSienaTest}.

If the algorithm object created by \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate}
uses \texttt{maxlike = FALSE}, the estimation function \sfn{sienacpp}
will use the MoM or the GMoM; the latter will be used as soon as
at least one of the effects were specified in the effects object with
\texttt{type = "gmm"}.

The specification of the effects object for GMoM estimation requires
that in the effects object, apart from the basic rate effects,
some of the effects were specified
in  \sfn{includeEffects} with \texttt{type = "eval"}
(the default, which means that this does not need to be stated)
and the others with \texttt{type = "gmm"}.
The first then are evaluation effects defining the model specification,
the second are statistics used for estimation.
The method requires that the number of statistics (\texttt{type = "gmm"})
is equal to or larger than the number of
evaluation effects (\texttt{type = "eval"}).
For example, the commands

\begin{verbatim}
net <- sienaDependent(array(c(s501,s502,s503), dim = c(50,50,3)))
dataset <- sienaDataCreate(net)
eff <- getEffects(dataset)
eff <- includeEffects(eff, density)
eff <- includeEffects(eff, density, type = "gmm")
eff <- includeEffects(eff, recip)
eff <- includeEffects(eff, recip, realrecip, persistrecip, type = "gmm")

Like the MoM, the GMoM allows conditional as well as unconditional
estimation (see Section~\ref{S_cond}).
In this example, for conditional estimation the number
of statistics will be nine, including the two statistics
for the rate parameters, viz., Hamming distances
between subsequent waves.

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation}
\label{S_ML}
\label{S_Bayes}

An important difference between estimation by the Method of Moments (MoM)
and estimation by the Method of Maximum Likelihood (ML) is that
the MoM tries to find parameters that will produce simulations,
given the beginning of the waves, for which
on average the target statistics are equal to their observed values;
whereas ML tries to find parameters for which the probability to arrive
in the observed data for the end of the waves, given the beginning
of the waves, is maximal. The MoM simulations take account only of the
observations at the start of the wave; the ML simulations
augment the data by connecting the
observations at the start of each wave with the observation at the end of the wave.
Such a connection may be called a \emph{change path}.
This is more complicated, and therefore more time-consuming.
Technical accounts of the MoM are in \citet{Snijders01,SnijdersEA07},
of the ML estimator in \citet{SnijdersEA10a}.
Both are presented in \citet{Snijders2017}.
\bigskip

ML estimation is done by the function \sfn{siena07}, using a set of options
created by \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} with \texttt{maxlike = TRUE}.
Bayesian estimation is done by the function \sfn{sienaBayes}.
The following further information in this section is about ML estimation;
Bayesian estimation is as yet implemented only for multilevel network modeling
(see Section~\ref{S_sienaBayes}).

There are some restrictions to the application of ML estimation.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The method of joiners and leavers (Section\ref{S_comp})
is not available.
  \item The following data configurations are not allowed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item tie variables in two consecutive waves changing from
    structural zero (code 10) to 1;
\item tie variables in two consecutive waves changing from
    structural one (code 11) to 0;
\item tie variables in three consecutive waves changing from
    structural zero (code 10) to \texttt{NA} to 1;
\item tie variables in three consecutive waves changing from
    structural one (code 11) to \texttt{NA} to 0;
\item and, for more than three consecutive waves, similar patterns
    with more NAs in between.
\end{enumerate}
\item Using structural zeros to indicate intermittent absence of actors
    (i.e., structural zeros only at the beginning or only at the end
    of a period)   is probably not a good idea.
     Above, some situations were mentioned that are logically impossible
     and therefore not allowed.
     In addition, the following is problematic:
\begin{itemize}
\item tie variables that are 0 or 1 at the beginning of a wave and
      structurally zero (code 10) at the end of the wave,
      indicating that the actor has left the network.\\
      The reason is that this contains the information for \RS that during
      this period, the tie variable has to change to the value 0;
      whereas probably you wish to convey the meaning that its value
      is unknown. At the end of a period, for a tie variable with
      the value 10, the contribution of this tie variable is not included
      in the computation of the log-likelihood,
      but through its dependence with other
      variables it still has consequences different from \texttt{NA}.
\end{itemize}
A solution for the problem of structural zeros at the end
of a period may be to replace them by \texttt{NA}.

For data sets with multiple periods (i.e., three or more waves), the
analysis using ML still is possible
\citep[as proposed by][]{delaHayeETAl2017} by arranging the data
as a multi-group data set (Section~\ref{S_multigroup}).
Unfortunately, this solution is not available for
\textsf{sienaBayes}.
\end{enumerate}

The ML estimation algorithm uses Metropolis-Hastings steps
to simulate the score function, which is the expected value
of the augmented-data score function;
see \citet{SnijdersEA10a}.
For ML estimation, an important parameter for tuning the
algorithm is the so-called \textsf{multiplication factor},
given in \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} as the argument \texttt{mult}.
This determines the number of Metropolis-Hastings steps taken
for simulating each new change path.
The number of steps (sometimes called `sampling frequency' in the literature)
is the multiplication factor multiplied by the sum over dependent variables
of the distances between successive waves.
When this is too low, the
sequentially simulated change paths are too similar, which will
lead to high autocorrelation in the generated statistics.
This leads to poor performance of the algorithm.
These autocorrelations are given in the output file. When some
autocorrelations are more than 0.4, it is good to increase the
\textsf{multiplication factor}.
When the \textsf{multiplication factor} is unnecessarily high,
on the other hand, computing time will be unnecessarily high.
The advice is to aim at values for the autocorrelations
between 0.1 and 0.4.

The number of Metropolis-Hastings steps (sampling frequency)
is potentially different for each wave,
and for the answer object \texttt{ans} these numbers are
given by \texttt{ans\$nrunMH}.

A practical way to proceed is as follows.
For initial tuning of the multiplication factor, use the model that
is obtained as the default after creating the effects object,
with very few effects included. The reason for using this model
is the limited computation time and easy convergence.
If the highest autocorrelation is more than 0.3, increase the
multiplication factor (e.g., by making it twice as large;
which will also lead to a twice as long computation time)
and estimate the model again.
If the highest autocorrelation is less than 0.1, then decrease
the multiplication factor and estimate again.
Tune the multiplication factor until the highest autocorrelation
is between 0.1 and 0.3.
Then start with estimating the models of interest.
For other models the autocorrelations may change again, therefore
it still can be important later on to adapt the multiplication factor
to keep the highest autocorrelation less than 0.4.

Note that the multiplication factor can be given as one number,
but also as a vector, with the number of elements equal to the number of
basic rate parameters in the effects object; i.e., the number
of periods times the number of waves. This permits setting a high
value of the multiplication factor for only some period-wave combinations.

Some advice about how to set the value of the multiplication factor
as a vector is in
\url{https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/sienaBayes_s.pdf};
this is formulated there for \textsf{sienaBayes}, but applies
equally well for ML estimation using \textsf{siena07}.
\medskip

The Metropolis Hastings algorithm uses a proposal distribution
composed of steps; see \citet{SnijdersEA10a} and
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}.
Abbreviated names of these steps are `InsDiag', `CancDiag', `Permute', `InsPerm',
`DelPerm', `InsMiss', `DelMiss', `InsMisdat', `DelMisdat', and `Move'.
The `Move' step was added in version 1.3.18, and is described in
\citet{Greenan2015}.
The probabilities of the first 7 steps are determined by the parameter \texttt{prML}
in  \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}. The probability of  `Move' is 1 minus the sum
of these 7 probabilities; `InsMisdat' and `DelMisdat' are offspring of `InsPerm" and
`DelPerm' and don't need their own proposal probability.
 `InsMiss' and  `DelMiss' are superfluous when there are no missing data,
but this is taken care of automatically and does not need to be specified in \texttt{prML}.
Currently, `Move' steps cannot be taken for data sets with
more than one dependent variable.
\medskip

Another parameter of the algorithm that sometimes needs tuning
(but less often than the multiplication factor)
is the \textsf{Initial value of the gain parameter}.
This determines the step sizes in the parameter updates in the iterative
algorithm.
It influences the stability and speed of moving of the algorithm.
A too low value implies that it takes very long to attain a
reasonable parameter estimate when starting from an initial
parameter value that is far from the `true' parameter estimate.
A too high value implies that the algorithm will be unstable,
and may be thrown off course into a region of unreasonable
(e.g., hopelessly large) parameter values.\\
When using the Method of Moments
(the default estimation procedure), it usually is unnecessary to change
this. In the ML case, when the autocorrelations are smaller
than 0.1 but the \texttt{t statistics for deviations from targets}
are relatively small (less than, say, 0.3) but do not all become
less than 0.1 in absolute value in repeated runs of the
estimation algorithm, then it will be good to decrease the
\textsf{initial value of the gain parameter}. Do this by dividing
it by, e.g., a factor 2 or a factor 5, and then try again
a few estimation runs.


\iffalse
\SI supplies three alternative MCMC algorithms for the
Bayesian estimation of the objective function parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] random walk M-H (default),
\item[(2)] autoregressive M-H,
\item[(3)] independence sampler.
\end{itemize}
The algorithms require the determination of the scale factor of
the so-called proposal distribution, which may affect the efficiency
of the algorithms and the accuracy of the results (for a given number of iterations).
It is recommended to make a short run with the default algorithm (1),
and then to make a longer run with algorithm (3);
and to choose as scale factor of the proposal
distribution $0$---which would be a pointless scale factor,
but which communicates to \RS that the user wishes to
leave the determination of the scale factor to the defaults provided in the algorithm,
which features an adaptive method for determining suitable
scale factors.
In the ideal case, the choice of algorithm does not affect the
results of primary interest, the parameter estimates---though the
efficiency of the algorithms and the accuracy of the results (for a
given number of iterations) may be affected.

Bayesian estimation gives rise to more results than the parameter
estimates printed in the output file.
The additional results can be best inspected by using {\tt R} and the
{\tt R} function {\tt siena}\_{\tt bayes} written by Michael
Schweinberger (see Section \ref{R_functions}).

\subsection{Supplementing {\tt R} functions}
\label{R_functions}

To examine the MCMC output of \RS for Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian estimation,
the {\tt R} functions {\tt siena}\_{\tt mle} and {\tt siena}\_{\tt bayes} can be used,
respectively,
which were programmed by Michael Schweinberger.
The {\tt R} functions input files generated by {\tt Siena} and output,
among other things,
trace plots and MCMC lag $1, \dots, 100$ autocorrelations of sampled entities
\citep[see][]{SchweinbergerSnijders07b, SchweinbergerSnijders07c},
and,
in the Bayesian case,
in addition $95\%$ posterior intervals, histograms, and Gaussian kernel density
estimates of the marginal posterior densities of the parameters.

The {\tt R} functions {\tt siena}\_{\tt mle} and {\tt siena}\_{\tt bayes}
can be downloaded from the website \\
{\tt http://stat.gamma.rug.nl/stocnet},
and can be used in {\tt R} as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Load the {\tt R} function:
\begin{itemize}
\item[---] ML estimation: \verb@source("siena_mle.r")@.
\item[---] Bayesian estimation: \verb@source("siena_bayes.r")@.

\subsection{Other remarks about the estimation algorithm}

\subsubsection{Conditional and unconditional estimation}
\label{S_cond}

\RS has two methods for MoM estimation and simulation:
\hypertarget{T_S_cond}{conditional and unconditional}. They differ
in the {\em stopping rule} for the simulations of the network
evolution. In unconditional estimation, the simulations of the
network evolution in each time period (and the co-evolution of the
behavioral dimensions, if any are included) carry on until the
predetermined time length (chosen as 1.0
for each time period between consecutive observation moments) has elapsed.
This is explained in \citet[][Section 4.2]{Snijders01}.

In conditional estimation, in each period
the simulations run on until a stopping
criterion is reached that is calculated from the observed data.
Conditioning is possible for each of the dependent variables
(network, or behavior), where `conditional' means `conditional on
the observed number of changes on this dependent variable'.
However, if there is more than one dependent variable
(network and/or behavior), estimation can be conditional only
on one of them.

Conditioning on the network variable means, for each period,
running simulations until the number of entries that differ
between the adjacency matrix of the
initially observed network of this period and the simulated network
\hypertarget{T_distance_stop}{is equal to the number} of entries
in the adjacency matrix that differ between the initially and the
finally observed networks of this period.

Conditioning on a behavioral variable means, for each period, running
simulations until the sum of absolute score differences on the behavioral
variable between the initially observed behavior of this period
and the simulated behavior is equal to the sum of absolute score
differences between the initially and the finally observed
behavior of this period.

Conditional estimation is slightly more stable and efficient,
because the corresponding rate parameters are not estimated by the
Robbins Monro algorithm, so this method decreases the number of
parameters estimated by this algorithm.
% Therefore, it is the
% default for models that do not include any dependent behavior
% variables. For models including dependent behavior variables,
% the default estimation type is unconditional (because in most
% applications, there will be no straightforward choice for the
% conditioning variable).
\medskip

The choice between
unconditional and the different types of conditional estimation is
made in the \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate} function by setting the
\textsf{cond} parameter.
For data specifications with multiple dependent variables,
at most one dependent variable can be used for conditioning.
This choice is made dependent on the
\textsf{condvarno} and \textsf{condname} parameters in this function.

If there are changes in network composition (see
Section~\ref{S_comp}), only the unconditional estimation procedure
is available.

If there are a lot of structurally determined values (see Section~\ref{S_struct})
then unconditional estimation is preferable.


\subsubsection{Fixing parameters}
\label{S_fixingparameters}

\hypertarget{T_fix}{Sometimes an effect must be present in the
model, but its precise numerical value is not well-determined.}
E.g., if the network at time $t_2$ would contain only reciprocated
choices, then the model should contain a large positive
reciprocity effect but whether it has the value 3 or 5 or 10 does
not make a difference. This will be reflected in the estimation
process by a large estimated value and a large standard error, a
derivative which is close to 0, and sometimes also by
\hyperlink{T_convergence}{lack of convergence of the algorithm}.
(This type of problem also occurs in maximum likelihood estimation
for logistic regression and certain other generalized linear
models; \label{LargeFix} see \citet[section 1.6]{GeyerThompson92},
\citet{AlbertAnderson84, HauckDonner77}.)
In such cases this effect
should be fixed to some large value and not left free to be
estimated. This can be specified
by using the \textsf{setEffect} function with the
\textsf{fix = TRUE} option.



\subsubsection{Automatic fixing of parameters}
\label{S_fixing}

If the algorithm encounters computational
problems, sometimes it tries to solve them automatically by fixing
one (or more) of the parameters. This will be noticeable because a
parameter is reported in the output as being fixed without your
having requested this. This automatic fixing procedure is used,
when in Phase~1 one of the generated statistics seems to be
insensitive to changes in the corresponding parameter.

This is a sign that there is little information in the data about
the precise value of this parameter, when considering the
neighborhood of the initial parameter values. However, it is
possible that the problem is not in the parameter that is being
fixed, but is caused by an incorrect starting value of this
parameter or one of the other parameters.

When the warning is given that the program automatically fixed one
of the parameter, try to find out what is wrong.

In the first place, check that your data were entered correctly
and the coding was given correctly, and then re-specify the model
or restart the estimation with other (e.g., 0) parameter values.
Sometimes starting from different parameter values (e.g., the
default values implied by the algorithm option
of `standard initial values") will lead to a good result.
Sometimes, however, it works better to delete this effect
altogether from the model.

It is also possible that the parameter does need to be included in
the model but its precise value is not well-determined. Then it is
best to give the parameter a large (or strongly negative) value
and indeed
\hyperlink{T_fix}{require it to be fixed}
(see Section~\ref{S_model}).


\subsubsection{Required changes from conditional to unconditional estimation}

Even though conditional estimation is slightly more efficient than
unconditional estimation, there is one kind of problem that
sometimes occurs with conditional estimation and which is not
encountered by unconditional estimation.

It is possible (but luckily rare) that the current parameter
values are such that the conditional
simulation does not succeed in ever attaining the condition required
by \hyperlink{T_distance_stop}{its stopping rule} (see
Section~\ref{S_cond}).
This will depend on the initial parameter values
and the changes that occurred during the Robbins-Monro process.
The solution is either to use different
(perhaps standard) initial values or to go over to
unconditional estimation.


\subsection{Using multiple processes}
\label{S_multipleProcesses}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  If multiple processors are available, then using
  multiple processes can speed up the estimation in \textsf{siena07},
  \sfn{sienacpp}, and \textsf{sienaGOF}.
  The help pages for these functions show how to do this.
  You can find out the number of processes possible by
\begin{verbatim}
library(parallel)
detectCores()
\end{verbatim}
  It is not advisable to utilize all available cores, because
  other processes also have to run. If you are not the only user
  of the machine, then there are obvious issues to be dealt with.

  There are some examples in the help page for \textsf{siena07}.
\item For estimation by Method of Moments (MoM), in Phases 1 and 3
  the simulations are performed in parallel. In Phase~2,
  multiple (viz., \texttt{nbrNodes} which is a parameter
  given in the call of \sfn{siena07}) simulations are done with the same parameters,
  and the resulting statistics are averaged for the updating step in the
  Robbins Monro algorithm. The gain parameter is increased and the
  number of iterations in Phase~2 reduced to take advantage of
  the increased accuracy of the update.\\
  When using the MoM, decrease in computation time will be somewhat less
  than proportional to the number of processes used, if this number is less than
  (say) 10; larger number of processes will have diminishing proportional
  returns.

\item For estimation by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and by \sfn{sienaBayes},
  parallelization goes by period; for multi-group data sets, period $\times$
  group. Therefore, for this type of estimation, the maximum meaningful number
  of parallel processes is \\ (number of waves -- 1) $\times$ (number of groups).

\item The parameters required to run all processes on one computer are fairly
  simple: in your call to \textsf{siena07}, set \sfn{nbrNodes} to the number of
  processes and \sfn{useCluster} and \sfn{initC} to TRUE. The \sfn{Model
    Options} screen also allows you to specify the number of processes, and
  will automatically set the other required parameters for you.

\item To use more than one machine is more complicated, but it can be done by
  using, in addition, the \sfn{clusterString} parameter.  The computers need to
  be running incoming \sfn{ssh}.
\item For machines with exactly the same layout of \R
  directories on each, simply set \sfn{clusterString} to a character vector of
  the names of the machines.
\item For other cases, e.g.\ using Macs alongside Linux,
  see the documentation for the package \sfn{parallel}.

\item \RS uses sockets for inter-process communication.
\item On Windows, sub processes are always started using \R scripts. On Linux
  and Mac there is an option available in \R version 2.14.0 or later via the
  code interface to \textsf{siena07} to ask for the sub processes to be formed by
  forking. See the help page for details.
\item Each process needs a copy of the data in memory. If there is insufficient
  memory available there will be no speed gain as too much time will be spent
  paging.
\item In each iteration the main process waits until all the other processes
  have finished. The overall speed is therefore that of the slowest process, and
  there should be enough processors to allow them all to run at speed.
\end{enumerate}




\newpage
\hypertarget{T_se}{
\section{Standard errors}
}
\label{S_se}

The estimation of standard errors of the MoM estimates requires
the estimation of derivatives,
which indicate how sensitive the expected values of the statistics
(see Section~\ref{S_algorithm}) are with respect to the parameters.
The derivatives can be estimated by two methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item finite differences method with common random numbers,
\item score function method.
\end{itemize}
The finite difference method is explained (briefly) in \citet{Snijders01},
the score function method was developed in \citet{SchweinbergerSnijders07a}
(where also the finite difference method is explained).
The score function method is preferable, because it is unbiased
and demands less computation time than finite differences,
although it requires more iterations in Phase~3 of the estimation algorithm
(see Section~\ref{S_algorithm}).
It is recommended to use the score function method with
at least 1000 iterations (default) in Phase~3.  For
published results, it is recommended to have at least\footnote{Earlier
recommendations in this manual were lower, `2000 to 4000'.
This is adequate in many cases; the increase to 5000 has the purpose
to be on the safe side.} 5000 iterations in Phase~3.

In some cases, with high correlations between parameters,
the estimation of standard errors is unstable and even 5000 may be not enough.
This can be checked this by running \textsf{siena07} several times, with different
random number seeds (or the default \texttt{seed = NULL} which also gives different
seeds every run).

A more extensive way of checking this is presented in the scripts\\
{\url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/SE_checks.R}~} \\
and \\
{\url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/RscriptStandardErrors.R}~}
\medskip


To calculate the standard errors for a
given set of estimates, when these estimates are good and do not need to be changed,
algorithm settings can be used with \texttt{nsub = 0}
in \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}, so phases 1 and 2 are
skipped and the whole operation of \textsf{siena07} takes considerably less time.
\medskip

The method for estimating derivatives is set
by the \sfn{findiff} parameter and the number of iterations in Phase~3
by the \sfn{n3} parameter, both in function \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}
that creates the object with specifications for the algorithm.

\subsection{Multicollinearity}

Multicollinearity means that the matrix that is inverted
to give the correlation matrix is ill-conditioned.
Correlations between parameter estimates
close to $\pm 1$ are the most usual signs of this.

If the parameter estimates are perfectly collinear
(standard errors of some parameters, or linear combinations
of parameters, being infinitely large), standard errors
are reported\footnote{Since version 1.1-285.}
as \texttt{NA} (the R term for "not available", missing).
This can happen depending on the data-model combination
(e.g., including the covariate-ego effect for a covariate with variance 0;
or including some effects that are collinear for any data set,
such as the combination of outdegree, transitive triplets,
outdegree activity, and balance effects --- see Snijders, 2005),
or on the combination of data, model and parameters (when a parameter
value was given or was reached where the model is not sensitive to some
parameter or combination of parameters).
The remedy here usually is to drop some of the effects.
\medskip

When \textsf{siena07} finds near-perfect collinearity at the end of the
estimation algorithm, it will give a warning message of the following kind.

\begin{verbatim}
*** Standard errors not reliable ***
The following is approximately a linear combination
for which the data carries no information:
0.5 * beta[8] + -0.41 * beta[9] + 1 * beta[14]
It is advisable to drop one or more of these effects.
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
This is based on automatic detection of linear dependencies
between the terms in the objective function (or linear predictor)
(\ref{obj.fu}). The coefficients are rounded.
This warning message signals that, very probably,
the combination of the effects mentioned causes the multicollinearity.
This multicollinearity is signaled for the parameter values as
obtained at the end of the algorithm.
\bigskip


In cases with strong but not complete multicollinearity,
i.e., correlations between some parameter estimates
(or some of their linear combinations) being close but not equal to --1 or +1,
the estimated standard errors are less reliable.
 Estimates for these correlations
are given under the heading
\texttt{Covariance matrix of estimates (correlations below diagonal)}
in the output file, and in the \textsf{summary(...)} of the estimation results
(see Section~\ref{S_collinear}).
Strong collinearity may in practice lead to large differences
between the estimated standard errors,
and also to considerable differences between the parameter estimates,
when comparing the results produced by different estimation runs.
The remedy is to reduce the model to a more parsimonious one
by excluding non-significant effects of which the parameter
estimates are highly correlated with others.

Provisionally (until further experience has been collected),
the following may be a reasonable guideline.
High parameter correlations with the outdegree effect are not a
reason for worry, but high parameter correlations with other effects are
a reason for checking the stability of the estimated standard errors. The
threshold for finding a parameter correlation `too high' in this respect
can be quite high, such as 0.95 (or 0.90).
In cases of high parameter correlations, estimating the model twice
(or more) and considering the stability of the standard errors will be
a good way for seeing whether there are reasons for special caution.
If the standard errors are stable, then parameter correlations above
0.90 still can be acceptable -- in particular, when they are obtained
for parameters that are significantly different from 0 and of which
estimates as well as standard errors are stable across repeated runs of
the estimation algorithm.
Also see the preceding section about the stability of standard errors.

\subsection{Precision of the finite differences method}

The implementation of the finite differences method is not
scale-invariant\footnote{The scales are determined by the
variable \sfn{z\$scale} in function \sfn{robmon}.
A better procedure would be to set the scale adaptively,
but the finite differences method is hardly ever used any more,
having been superseded by the score function method,
and therefore this improvement has not been effectuated.},
with the result that the standard errors produced by this method
are not very reliable if they are of the order of 0.02 or less.

\section{Tests}
\label{S_test}

Estimated parameters in \RS can be of three kinds:
basic rate parameters, indicated by the letter $\rho$ (rho), and specific for a
dependent variable -- period combination; other parameters for the rate function
(which may be absent from the model), indicated by the letter $\alpha$ (alpha);
and parameters that are weights for the objective function, indicated by $\beta$ (beta).
The basic rate parameters are necessarily positive,
so testing the null hypothesis that they are equal to~0 makes no sense.
For a combined notation, we denote the combination of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters
by the letter $\theta$ (theta); for non-conditional estimation,
$\theta$ will also include the basic rate parameters $\rho$.

For these parameters, two types of test are available in \si.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $t$-type tests of single parameters can be carried out by
dividing the parameter estimate by its standard error.
Under the null hypothesis that the parameter is 0,
these tests have approximately a standard normal distribution.
These may also be called Wald-type tests.
Section~\ref{Waldtest} indicates how to construct multi-parameter tests
from the same principle.

\item Score-type tests of single and multiple parameters
      are described in Section~\ref{S_Scoretest}.

\iffalse
\item
In the maximum  likelihood estimation method
it is possible to request likelihood ratio tests.
The log likelihood ratio is computed
by bridge sampling \citep{GelmanMeng98, HandcockHunter06}.
This can be requested (a bit deviously) by the number of runs in Phase~3
(defined in the  \hyperlink{T_S_options}{specification options}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the number of Phase~3 runs is a multiple of 100 plus 1
      (e.g., 101, 501, etc.), then
      the log likelihood ratio is calculated comparing
      the estimates obtained with the standard initial values.
\item If the number of Phase~3 runs is a multiple of 100 plus 2
      (e.g., 102, 502, etc.), then
      the log likelihood ratio is calculated comparing
      the estimates obtained with the initial values
      used in the current estimation procedure.
\end{enumerate}
The first option will be the most frequently useful, because it
yields log likelihood ratios which,
for different models fitted to a given data set,
all are comparable.
\fi
\end{enumerate}
In addition, there are procedures for assessing goodness of fit
as explained in Section~\ref{S_gof}.

\subsection{Wald-type tests}
\label{Waldtest}

Wald-type tests are based on the parameter estimates
and their covariance matrix.
Recall that the variances of the parameter estimates
are on the diagonal of this covariance matrix, and
the standard errors are the square roots of these diagonal
elements.

In Section \ref{S_fitcomp} we saw that, for a \textsf{sienaFit}
object \texttt{ans}, the estimates are given in
\texttt{ans\$theta}, the covariance matrix in \texttt{ans\$covtheta},
and the standard errors in \texttt{ans\$se}.
For testing the null hypothesis that component $k$ of the parameter
vector is 0,
\[
H_0 : \ \theta_k \,=\, 0 ,
\]
the $t$-test is based on
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hat\theta_k}{\se(\hat\theta_k)} \,=\,
   \texttt{ans\$theta[k] / ans\$se[k] } \ .  \label{t-stat}
\end{equation}
This can be easily calculated by hand from the \RS results.
It can also be obtained, e.g., from
\begin{verbatim}
Multipar.RSiena(ans, k)
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{k} is the sequence number of the effect.
The function \sfn{Multipar.RSiena} can be used for testing multiple
parameters simultaneously but, like in this example,
can be used also for a single parameter.
\medskip

In some cases, however, the $t$-statistic (\ref{t-stat}) does not have
an approximate standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis,
so that this test is not appropriate.
This is the so-called Donner-Hauck phenomenon, named after
\citet{HauckDonner77}, who first drew attention to this phenomenon
in the case of logistic regression. It is discussed also in
\citet[section 1.6]{GeyerThompson92} and \citet{AlbertAnderson84}.
For logistic regression this phenomenon occurs when there is complete,
or almost complete, separation of the set of observed values
for the vector of predictor variables such that this set
consists of values in two half-spaces,
where for one of these half-spaces the
dependent variable always is 0, and for the other half-space always 1.
The data then indicates that the parameter
should be very large in absolute value, but not how large;
mathematically, the estimated value may be infinite.
The parameter as estimated by a practical algorithm
then will be not infinite but large, and the standard error
also will be large;
but the point is that ratio (\ref{t-stat}) does not need to be large,
and the Wald test may be non-significant while
the data flatly contradicts a hypothetical parameter value of 0.
In Section~\ref{S_fixingparameters} we proposed that in such cases,
it may be helpful to fix the parameter at some large value,
without estimating it.
Or, when it is being estimated and the
overall maximum convergence ratio is
small so convergence is judged as good, this estimate can be used,
but in these cases, not its standard error.
One possibility that then is available to test the significance
is to make a second estimation run in which the parameter is fixed at
the value 0, corresponding to the null hypothesis, and test
this null value using the score-type test of Section~\ref{S_Scoretest}.
See the script \texttt{RscriptSienaMultiple.R} on the \SI webpage
for an example.

\subsubsection{Multi-parameter Wald tests}

Now suppose that we wish to test another null hypothesis,
which can be represented as a linear constraint on $\theta$:
\[
H_0 : \ A\,\theta \,=\, 0 ,
\]
where $A$ is a $r \times p$ matrix, the dimension of $\theta$ being $p$.
For example, if $p$ = 5, for testing
\[
H_0 : \ \theta_2 \,=\, \theta_3
\]
we would use the matrix
\[
   A \,=\, (0, 1, -1, 0, 0) \ ;
\]
while for testing
\[
H_0 : \ \theta_2 \,=\, \theta_3 \,=\, 0
\]
if $p$ = 5, we would use the matrix
\[
   A \,=\, \left( \begin{array}{l} 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 \\
                                   0, 0, 1, 0, 0
                  \end{array} \right) \ .
\]
Then the function \sfn{Wald.RSiena}
can be used to produce
the Wald-type test: the chi-squared value of the
test statistic, the number of degrees of freedom, and the $p$-value.

As an example, for the \textsf{klas12b} data
the following results were obtained,
collected in the \textsf{sienaFit} object \texttt{ans}.

The output of \texttt{summary(ans)} also contains the
covariance matrix of the estimates:

\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}
You probably do not need this as a user, but this covariance matrix
is used by \RS to carry out the tests.
To test the null hypothesis, e.g., that the three sex effects
(ego, alter, similarity) are zero,
the matrix $A$ is constructed as follows, and the Wald test then is requested.
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
A       <- matrix(0, 3, 8)
A[1, 6] <- 1
A[2, 7] <- 1
A[3, 8] <- 1
Wald.RSiena(A, ans)
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
The result is
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
chi-squared = 45.66, d.f. = 3;  p < 0.001.
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
The value $p < 0.001$ expresses strong evidence
that the network dynamics depends on sex.
\bigskip

The Wald test is frequently applied to test the null
hypothesis that several parameters are 0.
The extra work to define the matrix $A$ above can be automated
by using the following function \sfn{Multipar.RSiena}.
The test of the preceding example is then produced by the command
\begin{verbatim}
Multipar.RSiena(ans, 6, 7, 8)
\end{verbatim}
The output gives slightly more information:
\begin{verbatim}
Tested effects:
 friends: sex alter
 friends: sex ego
 friends: sex similarity
chi-squared = 45.66, d.f. = 3;  p < 0.001.
\end{verbatim}
If only one parameter is tested by this function, also the
one-sided statistic is given. For example, the effect
of knowing each other from primary school can be tested by
\begin{verbatim}
Multipar.RSiena(ans, 5)
\end{verbatim}
with the result
\begin{verbatim}
Tested effects:
 friends: primary
chi-squared = 19.52, d.f. = 1; one-sided Z = 4.42;  p < 0.001.
\end{verbatim}
The $Z$-value is just the square root of the chi-squared,
but with the sign of the parameter attached.


\subsubsection{Tests of linear combinations}

Sometimes there can be interest in a linear combination of parameters.
For example, this can arise when an evaluation and an endowment function
are included in the model.
This situation was explained in Section~\ref{S_endow} and
further elaborated in Section~\ref{S_c}.
Equations (\ref{fc_net}) and (\ref{fe_net}) imply that,
if there is no creation function,
the split between creation and maintenance can be made as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item creation of ties:\  evaluation parameter;
\item maintenance of ties:\ evaluation parameter + endowment parameter.
\end{itemize}

In an example using the Glasgow data (160 students, with joiners and leavers),
we obtained the following results (the LaTeX table was made by the function
\textsf{siena.table}).

\noindent
The effect of reciprocation on creation of ties is 4.392,
with $s.e. = 0.419$.
This can be tested by the ratio $t = 4.392/0.419 = 10.48$,
extremely strongly significant.
Suppose the \sfn{sienaFit} object is called \texttt{ans}.
The Wald test can also be obtained by the following.
Requesting the dimensionality \texttt{ans\$pp} is helpful to
confirm the numbering of the parameters. In this case, the dimension
is 12, and the tested parameter, reciprocity evaluation, is the fourth.
In terms of the formulae earlier in this section,
the tested parameter is $\theta_4$.
\begin{verbatim}
(p <- ans$pp)
mat <- matrix(0,1,p)
mat[1,4] <- 1
Wald.RSiena(mat, ans)
\end{verbatim}
with the result that $p=12$, and
\begin{verbatim}
chi-squared = 110.03, d.f. = 1; one-sided Z = 10.49;  p < 0.001.
\end{verbatim}
The difference between the values 10.48 and 10.49 is due to rounding.

The estimated effect of reciprocation on maintenance of ties is
$\hat\theta_4 + \hat\theta_5 = 4.392 - 1.640 = 2.752$.
Here the Wald test is obtained by
\begin{verbatim}
(p <- ans$pp)
mat <- matrix(0,1,p)
mat[1,4] <- 1
mat[1,5] <- 1
Wald.RSiena(mat, ans)
\end{verbatim}
with the result
\begin{verbatim}
chi-squared = 36.09, d.f. = 1; one-sided Z = 6.01;  p < 0.001.
\end{verbatim}

We can also get the standard error of the linear combination
$\hat\theta_4 + \hat\theta_5$ in the following way.
If $a$ is a vector with coefficients of the linear combination
$a'\,\theta$, in which we are interested, then
\begin{verbatim}
sum(a*ans$theta)
\end{verbatim}
 is the corresponding estimate,
\begin{verbatim}
a %*% ans$covtheta %*% t(a)
\end{verbatim}
is the variance, and
\begin{verbatim}
sqrt(a %*% ans$covtheta %*% t(a))
\end{verbatim}
is the standard error.
In this case, $a$ is the matrix \texttt{mat}.
Therefore the standard error is obtained as
\begin{verbatim}
sqrt(mat %*% ans$covtheta %*% t(mat))
\end{verbatim}
with the result 0.458.
Indeed $2.752 / 0.458 = 6.01$.

In this example, a further question is whether the effect of reciprocation
on creation of ties is equal to its effect on maintenance of ties.
This is simply tested by the parameter $\theta_5$, which ---as is implied
by the above--- is just the difference between the effects of reciprocation
on maintenance and on creation of ties. In this case, the difference is --1.640,
with $t$-ratio $t = -1.640/0.703 = -2.33$, $p < 0.05$.
We may conclude that, in this model, the effect of reciprocation on
creation of ties is significantly (two-sided $p < 0.05$) larger than
on maintenance of ties; but the latter, on itself,
still is significant.


\subsection{Score-type tests}
\label{S_Scoretest}

The Wald test is based on the estimate for the parameter,
and thereby integrates estimation and testing.
Sometimes, however, it can be helpful to separate these two
types of statistical evaluation.
This is the case notably when estimation is instable, e.g.,
when a model is considered with rather many parameters given
the information available in the data set,
or when the precise value of the estimate is not determined
very well as happens under the Donner-Hauck phenomenon
treated in the previous section.
The score-type test gives the possibility of testing
a parameter without estimating it.

This is done using the generalized Neyman-Rao score test
that is implemented for the Method of Moments estimation method
 in \si\ as a part of function \textsf{siena07}, following the methods
of \citet{Schweinberger12}.
For the ML estimation method,
following the same steps produces the \citet{Rao47} efficient score test.
Since the name of `score test' is associated with
likelihood-based analysis as in \citet{Rao47}, the test
of  \citet{Schweinberger12} that is associated with the Method of Moments
is called `score-type test'.

When using the score-type test, some model
is specified in which one or more parameters are restricted to some
constant, in most cases $0$ -- these constant values
define the null hypothesis being tested.
This can be obtained in \RS by appropriate choices in the effects dataframe.
Parameters can be restricted by
putting \texttt{TRUE} in the \sfn{fix} and \sfn{test} columns, and
the tested value in the \sfn{initialValue} column.
The function \textsf{setEffect} is available to do this.
For example, a score test for the evaluation effect of transitive ties
in a network can be requested as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
myeff <- setEffect(myeff, transTies, fix = TRUE, test = TRUE, initialValue = 0.0)
\end{verbatim}

The score-type test then
proceeds by simply estimating the restricted model (not the unrestricted model,
with unrestricted parameters) by the standard \SI estimation algorithm.
The result of the score-type test is presented in the \sfn{summary}
of the estimation results (the \sfn{sienaFit} object obtained from
\sfn{siena07}) and also in the output file.
The $t$-ratios for convergence can be disregarded for the parameters
that are fixed and estimated by the score test, as convergence is not an issue
for these parameters.

Score tests can also be obtained by the function \sfn{score.Test}.
This will provide score tests for any given subset of the parameters
that were fixed and tested in the \sfn{sienaFit} object given to it.
Note that while the  \sfn{summary} of this object and the results
in the output file give the score tests for the set of \underline{all}
fixed \& tested parameters, and for \underline{each} of these parameters
separately, the function \sfn{score.Test} can give the combined test
for \underline{any subvector}.

It should be noted that using the \sfn{prevAns} option in \textsf{siena07}
overrides the initial values in the effects object,
so that using \sfn{siena07} for an effects object with
\texttt{fix = TRUE} for some of the effects, jointly with
the \sfn{prevAns} option, will lead to score-type tests
of hypothesized values as given by the  \sfn{prevAns} option.
Since the presentation of the results includes the
hypothesized value, there is no reason for doubt as to what
has been done. However, mostly this is not what is desired,
and therefore it usually will be preferable to proceed as follows.
First update the initial values using \sfn{updateTheta}, then
set the hypothesized value by \sfn{setEffect}, and then
carry out the estimation and score-type test by \sfn{siena07}.
The following is an example, assuming that an earlier
reasonable estimate was found in \sfn{sienaFit} object \texttt{myans0},
and the user wishes to use this as starting values.
\begin{verbatim}
myeff <- updateTheta(myeff, myans0)
myeff <- setEffect(myeff, transTies, fix = TRUE, test = TRUE, initialValue = 0)
myans1 <- siena07(estimationSettings, data = mydata, effects = myeff)
summary(myans1)
\end{verbatim}


The one-step estimates are given in the file \texttt{pname.txt},
mentioned in Section~\ref{S_output}.
These are `quick and easy' estimates that are not totally
reliable, but that can be used as approximations of the unrestricted estimates
(that is, the estimates that would be obtained if the model were estimated
once again, but without restricting the parameter by \texttt{fix = TRUE}).
They are explained mathematically in \citet{Schweinberger12}.
Their computational advantage is based on the fact that they require simulations
only for parameter vectors where this parameter is fixed (usually, to 0;
but other values could be used, and this would be preferable if they are closer
to the resulting estimate).

\subsection{Example: one-sided tests, two-sided tests, and one-step estimates}
\label{example}

Suppose that it is desired to test the goodness-of-fit of the model
restricted by the null hypothesis that the reciprocity parameter is zero.
The following output may be obtained in the file \texttt{pname.txt},
mentioned in Section~\ref{S_output}:


{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
@2
Generalised score test <c>
--------------------------

Testing the goodness-of-fit of the model restricted by

 (1)   eval:  reciprocity                                 =  0.0000
________________________________________________

   c =   3.9982   d.f. = 1   p-value =   0.0455
   one-sided (normal variate):   1.9996
________________________________________________

One-step estimates:

l: constant network rate (period 1)                 6.3840
l: constant network rate (period 2)                 6.4112
eval:  outdegree (density)                          0.9404
eval:  reciprocity                                  1.2567
\end{verbatim}
}
To understand what test statistic {\tt <c>} is about, consider the case
where the network is observed at two time points, and let $R$
be the number of reciprocated ties at the second time point. Then it
can be shown that the test statistic is some function of
\[
  \mbox{Expected $R$ under the restricted model } - \mbox{ observed } R.
\]
Thus, the test statistic has some appealing interpretation in terms
of goodness-of-fit: when reciprocated ties do have added value for
the firms---which means that the reciprocity parameter is not 0,
other than the model assumes---then the deviation of the observed
$R$ from the $R$ that is expected under the model will be large
(large misfit), and so will be the value of the test statistic.
Large values of the test statistic imply low $p$-values, which, in
turn, suggests to abandon the model in favor of models incorporating
reciprocity.

The null distribution of the test statistic $c$ tends,
as the number of observations increases, to the chi-square
distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to the
number of restricted parameters. The corresponding $p$-value is
given in the output file.

In the present case, one parameter is restricted (reciprocity),
hence there is one degree of freedom {\tt d.f.\ = 1}. The value of
the test statistic {\tt c = 3.9982} at one degree of freedom
gives {\tt p = 0.0455}.
That is, it seems that reciprocity
should be included into the model and estimated as the other
parameters.

The one-sided test statistic, which can be regarded as normal variate, equals {\tt 1.9996}
indicating that the value of the transitivity parameter is positive.

In this example, the one-step estimate of reciprocity is {\tt 1.2567},
suggesting that this parameter is positive, which agrees with the one-sided test.

\subsubsection{Multi-parameter tests}

In the case where $K > 1$ model parameters are restricted, \RS
reports for the score test, in the \sfn{summary} and in the output file,
the test statistic with $K$ degrees of freedom. A low
$p$-value of the joint test would indicate that the
goodness-of-fit of the model is intolerable. However, the joint
test with $K$ degrees of freedom gives no clue as to what parameters
should be included into the model: the poor goodness-of-fit could be
due to only one of the $K$ restricted parameters, it could be due to
two of the $K$ restricted parameters, or due to all of them. Hence
\RS carries out, in addition to the joint test with $K$ degrees of
freedom, additional tests with one degree of freedom that test the
single parameters one-by-one. The goodness-of-fit table is as
follows:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

eval:  covariate_i similarity                       0.4147
\end{verbatim}
}

In the example output, three parameters are restricted.
The joint test has test statistic $c$, which has under the
null hypothesis a chi-squared distribution with d.f.\ = 3.
The $p$-value corresponding to the joint test indicates
that the restricted model is not tenable. Looking at the separate
tests, it seems that the misfit is due to all three parameters.
Thus, it is sensible to improve
the goodness-of-fit of the baseline model by including all of these parameters,
and estimate them.

If a simultaneous score test is desired for a subset of
the tested parameters with more than one element,
the function \sfn{score.Test} can be used.

\subsection{Alternative application: convergence problems}
\label{alternative}

An alternative use of the score test statistic is as follows. When
convergence of the estimation algorithm is doubtful, it is sensible
to restrict the model to be estimated. Either `problematic' or
`non-problematic' parameters can be kept constant at preliminary
estimates (estimated parameters values). Though such strategies may
be doubtful in at least some cases, it may be, in other cases, the
only viable option besides simply abandoning `problematic' models.
The test statistic can be exploited as a guide in the process of
restricting and estimating models, as small values of the test
statistic indicate that the imposed restriction on the parameters is
not problematic.

\subsection{Testing differences between independent groups or periods}

Sometimes it is interesting to test differences between parameters estimated for
independent groups. For example, for work-related support networks analyzed in
two different firms, one might wish to test whether the tendency to
reciprocation of work-related support, as reflected by the reciprocity
parameter, is equally strong in both firms.  Such a comparison is meaningful
especially if the total model is the same in both groups, as control for
different other effects would compromise the basis of comparison of the
parameters.

If the parameter estimates in the two networks are $\hat\beta_a$ and $\hat\beta_b$,
with standard errors $s.e._a$ and  $s.e._b$, respectively,
then the difference can be tested with the test statistic
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\hat\beta_a  - \hat\beta_b}{\sqrt{(s.e_a)^2 + (s.e_b)^2}} \ ,
\end{equation}
which under the null hypothesis of equal parameters,
$\beta_a = \beta_b$, has an approximating
standard normal distribution.

The same method can be used for comparing estimates obtained from
separate analyses for different periods from a data set with three
or more waves. For example, if there are three waves and separate analyses
were done for period~1 (wave~1 -- wave~2) and  period~2 (wave~2 -- wave~3),
then $\hat\beta_a$ could be an estimate obtained for period~1 while
$\hat\beta_b$ would be the estimate for the same parameter for period~2.
This is allowed because the analysis of period~2 conditions on wave~2.


\newpage
\subsection{Testing time heterogeneity in parameters}
\label{S_timetest2}

The model assumes that the parameter values $\beta_k$
of the objective function are constant over the periods from 1 to $M-1$.
This can be tested by the \sfn{sienaTimeTest} function,
as explained in this section.

We initially assume that $\beta$ does not vary over time, yielding a
\emph{restricted model}. Our data contains $|\mathcal{M}|$ observations, and we
estimate the restricted model the method of moments. We wish to test whether the
\emph{restricted model} is misspecified with respect to time
heterogeneity. Formally, define a vector of time dummy terms $\mathbf{h}$:
\begin{align}
h_k^{(m)}=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1& \{m : w_m \in \mathcal{W}, m \neq 1\}\\
0& \mbox{~elsewhere~}
\end{array}
\right . ,
\end{align}
where $k$ corresponds to an effect included in the model.\footnote{The dummy
  $\delta_k^{(1)}$ is always zero so that period $w_1$ is (arbitrarily)
  considered the reference period.} The explanation here
is formulated for the network evaluation function,
but the principle can be applied more generally.
An \emph{unrestricted model} which allows
for time heterogeneity in all of the effects is considered as a modification of
\eqref{f_net}:

\begin{align}
f^{(m)}_{ij}(\mathbf{x})= \sum_k \Big(\beta_k + \delta_k^{(m)} h_k^{(m)}\Big)
           \, s_{ik}\big(\mathbf{x}(i \leadsto j)\big)
\label{eq:fmij2}
\end{align}
where $\delta_k^{(m)}$ are parameters for interactions of the effects
with time dummies. One way
to formulate the testing problem of assessing time heterogeneity is the
following:
\begin{align}
H_0:\delta_k^{(m)} = 0 & \mbox{~for all~} k,m \notag\\
H_1:\delta_k^{(m)} \neq 0 & \mbox{ for some } k,m .
\label{hyptest}
\end{align}

This testing problem can be addressed by the score test in a way that
no extra estimation is necessary. This method was elaborated and proposed by
\citet{Lospinoso2011} and is implemented in RSiena.  To apply the
test to your dataset, run an estimation in the usual way, e.g. as follows
(we specify \texttt{nsub = 2, n3 = 100} just to have an example that runs
very quickly):
\begin{verbatim}
myalgorithm <- sienaAlgorithmCreate(nsub = 2, n3 = 100)
mynet1      <- sienaDependent(array(c(s501, s502, s503), dim = c(50, 50, 3)))
mydata      <- sienaDataCreate(mynet1)
myeff       <- getEffects(mydata)
myeff       <- includeEffects(myeff, transTrip, balance)
ans2        <- siena07(myalgorithm, data = mydata, effects = myeff, batch = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
and conduct the timetest through
\begin{verbatim}
## Conduct the score type test to assess whether heterogeneity is present.
tt2 <- sienaTimeTest(ans2)
plot(tt2, effects = 1:2)
\end{verbatim}

When time heterogeneity is found, there are several options for how to continue.
One option is to break apart the set of periods, and do the analysis separately
for smaller subsets of waves. The extreme of this is to do a wave-by-wave analysis,
i.e., an analysis for each pair of consecutive waves.
Then there is no issue of heterogeneity, and the results
will show in some cases that the heterogeneity affects only one or a few parameters.
Depending on the non-constant pattern that is shown by some of the parameters,
a new time-varying actor variable, or several, can be defined to
capture this heterogeneity,
and the analysis may be done for the set of all periods, for a model including
interactions of this time varying covariate with the effects for
which heterogeneity was found. This is the second option.
The time-varying actor variable could be a linear function of time, a time dummy,
or whatever.
The summary of \sfn{sienaTimeTest} gives information that can
be used to see which waves, and which effects, are mainly responsible for
the time heterogeneity. A wave-by-wave analysis may give this information
more clearly, but is more work.

One possibility for time-varying covariates is a time dummy variable.
This is available in an automated way in the
function \sfn{includeTimeDummy}. An example is
\begin{verbatim}
myeff <- includeTimeDummy(myeff, recip, balance, timeDummy = "2")
ans3  <- siena07(myalgorithm, data = mydata, effects = myeff, batch = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
after which you can test the new model again,
\begin{verbatim}
tt3 <- sienaTimeTest(ans3)
\end{verbatim}
and so on.

\newpage
\section{Simulation}
\label{S_sim}

The simulation option simulates the network evolution for fixed
parameter values. This is meaningful, e.g., for theoretical
exploration of the model, for goodness of fit assessment,
and for studying the sensitivity of the model to parameters.
Simulations are produced by the \textsf{siena07} function
also used for parameter estimation, but by calling it in
such a way that only Phase~3 is carried out
(see section~\ref{S_algorithm}).
This is done by requesting \texttt{nsub = 0} in
the model specification in function \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
By also requesting \texttt{simOnly = TRUE} the calculation
of standard errors, which usually is not meaningful when
simulating without estimating, is suppressed.
\begin{verbatim}
sim_model  <-  sienaAlgorithmCreate( projname = "sim_model", cond = FALSE,
                      useStdInits = FALSE, nsub = 0 , simOnly = TRUE)
sim_ans    <-  siena07(sim_model, data = mydata, effects = myeff )
\end{verbatim}
Mostly it is more meaningful to do this for non-conditional simulation
(hence \texttt{cond = FALSE}), and a two-wave data set,
so that the simulations are totally determined
by the parameters and the first observation.
The second wave then must be present in the data set only
because \RS requires it for estimation,
and here we are using a function that is originally
meant for estimation.
Parameter values are obtained from the effects object,
because of the option \texttt{useStdInits = FALSE}.
If the name of the effects object is \texttt{myeff},
the current parameter values are obtained from requesting
\begin{verbatim}
myeff
\end{verbatim}
and different values can be specified by assigning the
desired value to the vector
\begin{verbatim}
myeff$initialValue[myeff$include]
\end{verbatim}

When artificial data sets are generated that have a close link to observed data,
the restriction that simulations follow the monotonicity patterns that
might be present in the data (see Section~\ref{S_monotone}) can be undesirable.
This restriction can be lifted by using \texttt{allowOnly = FALSE}
in the call of \textsf{sienaDependent} (see the help file for this function).
This parameter will then set any \texttt{uponly} and \texttt{downonly}
flags to \texttt{FALSE}, precluding monotonicity constraints.

\iffalse
When only 1 run is requested, an entire data set is generated
and written to file in \SI format and also in Pajek format.
%When exactly 10 runs are requested and the maximum likelihood option is chosen,
%then the sequence of changes
%from each observation to the next is written to file \textsf{{\em pname}.cha}
%in the format described in Section~\ref{S_lalgo}.
\fi

The statistics generated, which are the statistics
corresponding to the effects in the model,
can be accessed from the \textsf{sienaFit}
object produced by \textsf{siena07}.
Denoting the name of this object by \texttt{sim\_ans},
its component  \texttt{sim\_ans\$sf} contains the generated
deviations from targets. As discussed also in Section~\ref{S_fitcomp},
the statistics can be recovered from the deviations and the targets
as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
# To get the generated statistics without subtracting the targets,
# we have to add the targets to the deviations.
# To do this, repeated transposition t can be used:
stats       <-  t(t(sim_ans$sf) + sim_ans$targets)
# Calculate means and covariance matrix:
v           <-  apply(stats,2,mean)
covsf       <-  cov(stats)
# covsf is the same as sim_ans$msf
\end{verbatim}
Of course, any other distributional properties of the
generated statistics can also be obtained by the
appropriate calculations and graphical representations in \Rn.

\subsection{Accessing the generated networks}
\label{S_sims}

If one is interested in the networks generated, not only
in the statistics internally calculated,
then the entire networks can be accessed.
This is done by using the \textsf{returnDeps} option, as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
sim_ans <- siena07( myalgorithm, data = mydata, effects = myeff,
                    returnDeps = TRUE )
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{returnDeps = TRUE} option attaches a list \texttt{sim\_ans\$sims}
containing all simulated networks
as edge lists to the \texttt{sim\_ans} object.
This uses rather a lot of memory.
Since here the default \texttt{n3 = 1000} was used, \texttt{sim\_ans} will be
a list of 1000 elements; e.g., if there are three waves, the 568'th network generated
for wave 2 is given by
\begin{verbatim}
sim_ans$sims[[568]][[1]][[1]][[1]]
\end{verbatim}
The numbering is as follows: first the number of the simulation run (here,
arbitrarily, 568); then the number of the group as defined in
Section~\ref{S_multigroup} (1 in the usual case of single-group data structures);
then the number of the dependent variable (here 1, because it is supposed
that there only is a dependent network);
then the period number (i.e., wave number minus 1).
This type of information can be found out by requesting
\begin{verbatim}
str(sim_ans$sims[[568]])
\end{verbatim}
\bigskip

In the case of maximum likelihood estimation,
if there is only one group and two waves, the list structure is simpler.
Then the two superfluous list levels, group and wave/period, are omitted.
The list then has three levels: dependent variable within group
within simulation run.
\bigskip

The help page for \textsf{siena07} contains an example for how to access the
generated networks in the case of ML estimation. Note that this is meaningful only in view
of the missing values of dependent variables for waves~2 and further, for which the
simulations in Phase~3 can be regarded as a kind of model-based imputation.

Section \ref{S_trafos} explains how such an edgelist can be
transformed to an adjacency matrix:
\begin{verbatim}
# Determine number of actors (normally the user will know this)
n <- length(mydata$nodeSets[[1]])
# create empty adjacency matrix
adj <- matrix(0, n, n)
# Make shorter notation for edge list
edges <- sim_ans$sims[[856]][[1]][[1]][[1]]
# put edge values in desired places
adj[edges[, 1:2]] <- edges[, 3]
\end{verbatim}

As an example, the following commands turn this list into
a list of edgelists according to the format of the \textsf{sna} package
\citep{Butts08}, and then calculate the maximum $k$-core numbers
in the networks.
This assumes that a one-mode network is being analyzed.
\begin{verbatim}
# First define a function that extracts the desired component
# from the list element,
# gives the column names required for sna edgelists,
# and adds the attribute defining the number of nodes in the graph,
# as required by sna.
make.edgelist.sna <- function(x, n)
                     {
                         x <- x[[1]][[1]][[1]]
                         colnames(x) <- c("snd", "rec", "val")
                         attr(x, "n") <- n
                         x
                     }
# Note: if there is only one group and two waves,
# x[[1]][[1]][[1]] should be replaced by x[[1]]
# Apply this function to the list of simulated networks
simusnas <- lapply(sim_ans$sims, make.edgelist.sna, 50)
# Define a function that calculates the largest k-core number in the graph
library(sna)
max.kcores <- function(x)max(kcores(x))
# Apply this function and make a histogram
mkc <- sapply(simusnas, max.kcores)
hist(mkc)
\end{verbatim}
\bigskip

Another possibility is to use the extractor functions,
\sfn{sparseMatrixExtraction}, \sfn{networkExtraction}, or \sfn{behaviorExtraction}
that are also used for \sfn{sienaGOF}.


\iffalse
For simulating networks and behavior, the output includes
the autocorrelation statistics known as Moran's $I$ and Geary's $c$.
For formulae and interpretation see, e.g., \citet[98--99]{Ripley81}.
These measure the extent to which the value of the variable
in question is similar between tied actors.
This similarity is expressed by relatively high values for Moran's $I$
and by relatively low values for Geary's $c$.
The null values, which are the expected values for variables
independent of the network, are given by $-1/(n-1)$ for Moran's $I$
and by 1 for Geary's $c$.

(The output of the descriptive statistics, which can be obtained
from \textsf{Siena02}, also contains Moran's $I$ and Geary's $c$,
computed for the observed data, together with their
null means and standard deviations.)
\fi


\subsection{Conditional and unconditional simulation}
\label{S_conds}

The distinction between conditional and unconditional simulation
is the same for the simulation as for
\hyperlink{T_S_cond}{the estimation option}
of \si, described in Section~\ref{S_cond}.
The choice between conditional and
unconditional simulation is
made in the \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate} function by setting the
\textsf{cond} parameter, possibly also the
\textsf{condvarno} and \textsf{condname} parameters.

If the conditional option is chosen, then the simulations
carry on until the desired distance is achieved on the dependent
variable used for conditioning.
For networks, the distance is the number of differences in the
tie variables; for behavioral variables, the sum
across actors of the absolute differences.
This is determined as the
distance between the consecutive networks (or, behaviors,
if such a variable is used for conditioning) given in the call of
\textsf{sienaDataCreate}.
The rate parameter for this dependent variable then
has no effect.

If the conditional simulation option was chosen (which is the
default) and the simulations do not succeed in achieving the
condition required by
\hyperlink{T_distance_stop}{its stopping rule}
(see Section~\ref{S_cond}), then the simulation is
terminated with an error message, saying
\emph{Unlikely to terminate this epoch}.
In this case, you are advised to change to unconditional simulation.


\subsection{Simulating with variable parameter values}

The procedures described until now in this chapter conduct the simulations
in Phase~3 with a constant parameter vector.
If \texttt{nsub = 0} this parameter value is given in the effects object,
and returned for the resulting \textsf{sienaFit} object \texttt{ans}
as \texttt{ans\$theta}.
It is also possible to use a different parameter vector in every
run of Phase~3. This is done by specifying a matrix of parameter
values (runs in the rows, parameters in the columns) as the
argument \texttt{thetaValues} for \textsf{siena07}.
This requires specifying \texttt{simOnly = TRUE}.
The parameter values actually used are then returned
in \texttt{ans\$thetaUsed}.

If parallel processes are used (\texttt{useCluster = TRUE})
and the number of processes is \texttt{nbrNodes} $ > 1$,
the parameters used will be constant in each set of \texttt{nbrNodes}
consecutively stored simulations.
If the number of rows of \texttt{thetaValues} is not large enough
given the values of \texttt{n3} and \texttt{nbrNodes},
the last row of \texttt{thetaValues} will continue to be used.
All this will be reflected by the value of \texttt{ans\$thetaUsed}.


\newpage
\section{Getting started}
\label{S_getting}

Note that there is a section `Getting started' in the Minimal
Introduction: Section~\ref{S_minsi1}. It may be best
to go through that section first.

The best way to get started is to download the \R scripts from the
\SI website and start reading and playing with them.

For carrying on and getting a first acquaintance with your own running
of the model, the data set collected by Gerhard van de Bunt
is useful; this data is discussed extensively in
\citet*{vanBunt99, vanBuntEA99},
and used as example also in \citet{Snijders01} and \citet{Snijders05}.
The data files are provided with the program
and at the \SI website. The digraph data files
used are the two networks {\sf vrnd32t2.dat}, {\sf vrnd32t4.dat}.
The networks are coded as 0 = unknown, 1 = best friend, 2 = friend,
3 = friendly relation, 4 = neutral, 5 = troubled relation, 6 = item
non-response, 9 = actor non-response.
Recode the network so that values 1, 2, and 3 are interpreted
as ties for the first as well as the second network, and values 6 and 9
are missing data codes (\texttt{NA}).

The actor attributes are in the file {\sf vars.dat}. Variables
are, respectively, gender (1 = $F$, 2 = $M$), program, and smoking
(1 = yes, 2 = no). See the \sfn{Data sets} tab at the
\SI website, and the references mentioned above for further
information about this network and the actor attributes.

Create the various required objects, using functions
\textsf{sienaDataCreate}, \textsf{getEffects}, and \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate},
as indicated in Chapters~\ref{S_InputData} and~\ref{S_Est}.
At first, leave the whole model specification as
it is by default (see Section \ref{S_modspec}):
a constant rate function, the out-degree effect, and
the reciprocity effect.

Then let the program estimate the parameters, using function \textsf{siena07}.
You will see a
screen with intermediate results: current parameter values, the
differences (`deviation values') between simulated and observed
statistics (these should average out to 0 if the current
parameters are close to the correct estimated value), and the
\hyperlink{T_quasiac}{quasi-autocorrelations} discussed in Section
\ref{S_Est}.

It is possible to intervene in the algorithm by clicking on the
appropriate buttons:
the algorithm may be restarted or terminated. In most cases
this is not necessary.

A little bit of patience is needed to let the machine complete its three
phases.
%How this depends on the data set and the number of parameters
%in the model is indicated in Section~\ref{S_timeuse}.
When the algorithm has finished, look at the results in the output file
or by the \sfn{print} or \sfn{summary} function of the
resulting \sfn{sienaFit} object. Check
that the overall maximum convergence ratio is small enough
(ideally less than .25).
If not, continue estimation with the \sfn{prevAns} option
as discussed in Section~\ref{S_ccheck}.
When satisfactory convergence has been obtained, make sense
of the results: for example, is the reciprocity parameter significant?

As further steps, include some extra effects. First candidates
are the transitive triplets effect or the gwesp effect, and any
effects that may follow from your theories about the investigated network
(see, e.g., Section~\ref{S_modspec});
you can find their \sfn{shortName},
needed to specify them, in Chapter~\ref{S_math},
where also the mathematical specifications are given.
When these new effects have been added, follow the same steps:
estimate, check convergence, if this is not yet satisfactory
estimate again with the new initial values, and interpret the
results when converged has been obtained.

To continue,  non-significant effects may
be excluded (but it is advised always to retain the out-degree and
the reciprocity effects) and other effects may be included,
as suggested in Section~\ref{S_modspec}.

\subsection{Model choice}
\label{S_model}

For the selection of an appropriate model for a given data set it
is best to start with a simple model (including, e.g., 2 or 3
effects), delete non-significant effects, and add further effects
in groups of 1 to 3 effects. Like in regression analysis, it is
possible that an effect that is non-significant in a given model
may become significant when other effects are added or deleted!

When you start working with a new data set, it is often helpful first
to investigate the main endogenous network effects (reciprocity,
transitivity, etc.) to get an impression of what the network
dynamics looks like, and later add effects of covariates.
The most important effects are discussed in Section~\ref{S_modspec};
the effects are defined mathematically
in Chapter~\ref{S_math}.

\iffalse
Here we give a more qualitative description.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{out-degree effect} which always must be included.
\item The \emph{reciprocity effect} which practically always must be included.
\item There is a choice of four network closure effects.
      Usually it will be sufficient to express the tendency to network
      closure by including one or two of these. They can be selected
      by theoretical considerations and/or by their empirical
      statistical significance.
      Some researchers may find the last effect (distances two)
      less appealing because it expresses network closure
      inversely.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
      \begin{minipage}[t]{.6\textwidth}
      The \emph{transitive triplets effect}, which is
               the classical representation of network closure by the number of transitive
               triplets.
               For this effect the contribution
               of the tie $i \rightarrow j$ is proportional to the total number
               of transitive triplets that it forms -- which can be transitive triplets
               of the type
               $\{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow h ;\ i \rightarrow h \}$
               as well as $\{i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j ;\ i \rightarrow j \}$;

      \item[b.] The \emph{balance effect}, which may also be called \emph{structural equivalence
                with respect to outgoing ties}.
                This expresses a preference of actors to have ties to those other actors
                who have a similar set of outgoing ties as themselves.
                Whereas the transitive triplets effect focuses on how many same choices
                are made by ego (the focal actor) and alter (the other actor)
                --- the number of $h$ for which
                $i \rightarrow h$ and $j \rightarrow h $, i.e., $x_{ih} = x_{jh} = 1$
                where $i$ is ego and $j$ is alter --- ,
                the balance effect considers in addition how many the same
                non-choices are made --- $x_{ih} = x_{jh} = 0$.
      \item[c.] The \emph{transitive ties effect} is similar to the transitive
                triplets effect, but instead of considering for each other actor $j$
                how many two-paths $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j $ there are,
                it is only considered whether there is at least one such indirect connection.
                Thus, one indirect tie suffices for the network embeddedness.
      \item[d.] The \emph{number of actors at distance two effect} expresses network closure inversely:
                stronger network closure (when the total number of ties is fixed)
                will lead to fewer geodesic distances equal to 2.
                When this effect has a negative parameter, actors will have a preference
                for having few others at a geodesic distance of 2 (given their
                out-degree, which is the number of others at distance 1);
                this is one of the ways for expressing network closure.

      interpreted as a tendency toward hierarchy.
      The three-cycles effect also contributes to

Approaches to model specification are presented in Chapter~\ref{S_modspec}
and in \citet*{SnijdersEA10b}.

When the distribution of the out-degrees is fitted poorly
(which can be inspected using the \textsf{sienaGOF} function
of Section~\ref{S_gof}), an improvement
usually is possible either by including non-linear effects of the
out-degrees in the evaluation function, or by other improvements of the model.
This totally depends on the data set at hand.
%, or by changing to Model Type 2
%(see Section~\ref{S_modeltype}).

\section{Multilevel network analysis}
\label{S_mulev}

For combining \RS results of several independent networks,
there are four options.
(`Independent'  networks here means that the sets of actors are
disjoint, and it may be assumed that there are no direct influences
from one network to another.)
The first two options assume that the parameters
of the actor-based models for the different
networks are the same -- except
for the basic rate parameters and for
those differences that are explicitly modeled by interactions
with dummy variables indicating the different networks.
All but the second option require that the number of observations
is the same for the different networks.
These methods can be applied for two or more networks.
\medskip

In the following discussion,
the terms `networks' and `groups' are used interchangeably.

\noindent
The four options are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Combining the different networks in one large network,
      indicating by structural zeros that ties between the
      networks are not permitted.
      This is explained in Section~\ref{S_struct}.\\
      The special effort to be made here is the construction
      of the data files for the large (combined) network.
      This is superfluous; it is better to use option~2.
\item Combining different groups
      into one \emph{multi-group} data set,
      and analyzing this by \textsf{siena07}.
      The `groups' are the same as the `different networks'
      mentioned here.
      This is explained in Section~\ref{S_multigroup}.\\
      A difference between options 1 and 2 is that the use
      of structural zeros (option 1) will lead to a default specification
      where the rate parameters are equal across networks
      (this can be changed by making the rate dependent upon dummy actor
      variables that indicate the different networks)
      whereas the multi-group option yields rate parameters
      that are distinct across different networks.\\
      In this option (like in option~1), the assumption is made that all
      parameters are the same for the various networks,
      except for the basic rate parameters;
      and except for explicitly specified interaction
      effects between variables depending on the group, and other effects.
      This is a very strong assumption, and undesirable unless
      options 3-4 are impossible.
\item Analyzing the different networks separately, without any assumption
      that parameters are the same but using the same model specification,
      and post-processing the output files by a meta-analysis
      using \textsf{siena08}.
      This is explained in Section~\ref{S_Siena08}.
\item Combining different groups into one \emph{multi-group} data set
      as in option (2), but analyzing this by \textsf{sienaBayes}.
      This is explained in Section~\ref{S_sienaBayes}.\\
      Here the assumption for the parameters is that all basic rate parameters
      may differ arbitrarily between the groups;
      for the other parameters, some are identical and others vary randomly across
      groups according to a multivariate normal distribution.
      The distinction between `some' and `others' here is made by
      the parameter \texttt{random} in function \sfn{setEffect}.
\end{enumerate}
The first and second options will yield nearly the same results, with the
differences depending on the basic rate (and perhaps other) parameters
that are
allowed to differ between the different networks, and of course
also depending on the randomness of the estimation algorithm.
The second option is more `natural' given the design of \RS and
will normally run faster than the first.
Therefore the second option seems preferable to the first.

The third option makes much less assumptions because parameters are not
constrained at all across the different networks.
This is preferable to the assumption of homogeneous parameters
made in options 1 and~2.
The fourth option is a middle ground between the first two and the third.
The arguments usual in statistical modeling apply:
as far as assumptions is concerned, options (3) and (4) are safer;
but if the assumptions are satisfied (or if they are a good approximation),
then options (1) and (2) have higher power and are simpler.
Option (3) requires that each of the different network data sets
is informative enough to lead to well-converged estimates;
this will not always be the case for small data sets,
and then option (4) may be preferable.

One difference between option 3 and the others is the centering of covariates;
if this is used (which is the default!).
For actor covariates, the multi-group data sets will center actor covariates
by subtracting the grand mean; in the individual data sets analyzed in option~3,
groupwise means are subtracted, This will affect the results.
In some cases, for a multi-group analysis by option 2 or 4, it will be desirable
not to center and/or to also use the groupwise means of covariates
as an additional covariate.

When the data sets for the different networks are not too small
individually,
then a middle ground might be found in the following way.
Start with option (3). This will show for which parameters there are
important differences between the networks.
Next follow option (2), with interactions between the group dummies
and those parameters for which there were important between-network
differences; or option (4), where the randomness of the effects
is determined by these differences.

When the data sets for the different networks are quite small,
then one might start by option (2), and use \textsf{sienaTimeTest} to test
for which of the effects especially there is a large variation in
parameter values across the groups;
next one could follow approach (4), determining the randomness of the effects
by the results about this variability.

In all cases, it is probably best to use an identical model specification
for the various groups. A problem that may occur especially if the groups
are small is that in some of the groups the change of the dependent variable
(network or behavior) may be upward only or downward only, which by default
then will be regarded by \RS as a constraint for the simulations,
as mentioned in Section~\ref{S_monotone}.
This leads to model differences that in most cases will be undesirable.
Therefore it is advisable in the original construction of the datasets
to use \texttt{allowOnly = FALSE} in the call of \textsf{sienaDependent}.

\subsection{Function \textsf{sienaGroupCreate}  }
\label{S_multigroup}

The function \textsf{sienaGroupCreate} operates on a list
of \sfn{siena} data sets created by \textsf{sienaDataCreate},
containing variables with the same names and of the same types.
It creates a so-called \sfn{sienaGroup} object, which is a list of
\sfn{siena} data objects with some additional information
contained in attributes.
This is used for options 2 and~4.
For option~2 the numbers of waves may differ between the groups,
for option~4 the groups all should have the same number of waves.

For centered actor covariates, function \textsf{sienaGroupCreate}
centers the original values again, now around the overall mean.
This allows the use of centered actor covariates that are
constant within groups.
The \texttt{egoX} effect of a centered covariate,
e.g., will be the sender effect of the original variable
with grand-mean centering. For the \texttt{altX} effect the centering
makes no difference.

For actor covariates, function \textsf{sienaGroupCreate} recalculates
attributes \texttt{range}, \texttt{range2}, and \texttt{simMean}.
Since version 1.3.4,
the attributes \texttt{range} and \texttt{range2} for each group are set
at the range of this covariate in all groups.
The \texttt{simMean} attribute
of a group is set at the average of the similarity values
for this group using the overall range.
This implies that the parameters of the \texttt{simX} effect refer
to the similarity transform (\ref{simV})
normalized with respect to the same range
$r_V$ for all groups; and the centering of this transform,
which affects the parameter of the \texttt{outdegree (density)} effect,
is group-specific.

\subsection{Multi-group Siena analysis}
\label{S_multigroup}

The multi-group option `glues' several Siena data sets
(further referred to as \emph{groups}) one after the other
into one larger multi-group data set.
These groups must have the same sets of variables of all kinds:
that is, the list of dependent networks, dependent behavioral variables,
actor covariates, and dyadic covariates must be the same
for the various groups.
Also their names must be the same.
The number of actors and the number of waves can be different, however.

Gluing the groups together means that the observations (waves) of the groups
are arranged after each other, so the total number of observations
in the multi-group data set is the sum over all groups of the
number of observations per group. In this way
the groups then are combined into one Siena data set
where the number of actors is the largest of the number of
actors of the groups, and the number of observations
is the sum of the observations of the groups.
Constant covariates (whether monadic or dyadic) are transformed
to changing covariates, because the groups now are regarded
as multiple observations.

This is done by the function \textsf{sienaGroupCreate} which creates
a so-called \texttt{sienaGroup} object, which is a list of
\texttt{siena} objects with some additional information.

As an example, suppose that three Siena data sets with names {\tt sub1}, {\tt sub2},
and {\tt sub3} are combined. Suppose {\tt sub1} has 21 actors and
2 observations, {\tt sub2} has 35 actors and 4 observations,
and {\tt sub3} has 24 actors with 5 observations.
Then the combined multi-group group has 35 actors and 11 observations.
The step from observation 2 to 3 switches from group {\tt sub1}
to group {\tt sub2}, while
the step from observation 6 to 7 switches from group {\tt sub2}
to {\tt sub3}. These switching steps do not correspond to simulations
of the actor-based model, because that would not be meaningful.

The different groups are considered to be unrelated
except that they have the same model specification,
the same variable names, and the same parameter values.
It is important to check that this is a reasonable assumption.
One aspect of this is by looking at the descriptives for change
produced by \textsf{print01Report}, and checking that the
tendencies in the dependent variable or variables, upward/stable/downward,
are not too different between the groups.
The \textsf{sienaTimeTest} function can be used for
formally testing this assumption.
Moderate violations ($p$-values larger than 0.01) will probably
be acceptable in the sense that the combined results
still are a meaningful aggregate, strong violations are not acceptable
and should be remedied by dropping some of the groups or by
including an interaction term.

Given the potentially large number of periods that can be implied
by the multi-group option, it probably is advisable,
when using Method of Moments estimation, to use
the conditional estimation option.

In multi-group groups, individual covariates are centered by subtracting
the overall mean (across all groups), but dyadic covariates are centered
by subtracting the within-group means.



\subsection{Meta-analysis of Siena results}
\label{S_Siena08}

The function \textsf{siena08} is a meta-analysis method for \si.
It combines estimates for a common model
   estimated for several data sets,
   that must have been obtained earlier.
   This function combines
   the estimates in a meta-analysis or multilevel analysis
   according to the methods of \citet{SnijdersBaerveldt03},
   and according to a Fisher-type combination of one-sided $p$-values.

The function  \textsf{siena08} takes as input the \textsf{sienaFit}
objects produced by separate runs of  \textsf{siena08}.
These \textsf{sienaFit} objects must have exactly the same model
specification and the same names of all variables; but it is allowed
that there are differences with respect to parameters being fixed
and perhaps tested. To get the same names of variables, the
variables must be renamed in the call of \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate};
an example is in script \textsf{RscriptMultipleGroups.R} at the \SN website.
If in some but not all groups a dependent variable has only upward or
only downward changes, the automatic restriction to follow this pattern also
in the simulations (see Section~\ref{S_monotone}) must be lifted,
because this would make the model specifications different.
This must be done already in the original construction of the datasets that
then later are combined by \textsf{siena08},
by using \texttt{allowOnly = FALSE} in the call of \textsf{sienaDependent},
as mentioned in Section~\ref{S_monotone}.

If there are some parameters that cannot be estimated for some of the data sets
(e.g., the effect of sex in a one-gender school; or because of
near-multicollinearity), these parameters must still be included
in the model for those data sets, but the parameters can be fixed to 0
(and perhaps tested by a score-type test).
\medskip

Each parameter in the model is treated separately
in the meta-analysis, without taking account of the
dependencies between the parameters and their estimates.
Denote the number of combined data sets by $N$.
If we denote a given parameter (e.g., the
coefficient of the reciprocity effect) by $\theta$,
then the \emph{true parameter values} for the
$N$ data sets are denoted $\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_N$,
while their \emph{estimates} are denoted
 $\hat\theta_1, \hat\theta_2, \ldots, \hat\theta_N$.
 \bigskip

The package \sfn{metafor} can also be used for meta-analysis.
This package is extensively documented in \citet{Viechtbauer2010}.
In terms of \citet{Viechtbauer2010}, \sfn{siena08} follows a
random effects approach and presents the Hedges estimator
which is the procedure of \citet{SnijdersBaerveldt03}, proposed
by \citet{Cochran54}; it also presents the maximum likelihood
estimator.
In \citet{Viechtbauer2005}, an extensive study is made comparing
the various approaches, and it turns out that the comparison is
not unequivocal. His recommendation, however, is to use the
restricted maximum likelihood estimator.
Since this is not implemented in \sfn{siena08}, this recommendation
suggests that one should rather use  \sfn{metafor}, with the
option \texttt{method = "REML"}.

Still another possibility is offered by the package \sfn{mvmeta}
\citep{Gasparrini2012}.
This was used in conjunction with \RS by
\citet{An2015}, who showed how to use this for incorporating
group-level explanatory variables, using a fixed effects
as well as a random effects approach, the latter with
restricted maximum likelihood.

\subsubsection{Meta-analysis directed at the mean
               and variance of the parameters}

In this meta-analysis it is assumed that the data sets can be
regarded as a sample from a population -- i.e., a population
of dynamic networks -- and accordingly the true parameters
$\theta_j$  are a random sample from a population.
If the number of data sets is small, e.g., less than 20,
and especially if this number is less than 10,
this assumption is not very attractive from a practical point of view,
because the sample then would be quite small
so the information obtained about the population is very limited.

The mean and variance in this population of parameters are denoted
\begin{align*}
 \mu_\theta &= \E\, \theta_j \ , \\
 \sigma^2_\theta &= \var\, \theta_j \ .
\end{align*}
Each of these parameters must have been estimated in a run of
\textsf{siena07}, yielding the estimate $\hat\theta_j$,
which is the true parameter plus a statistical error $E_j$:
\[
\hat\theta_j \,=\, \theta_j + E_j \ .
\]
The standard error of this estimate is denoted by $s_j$.

For each of the parameters $\theta$, the function \textsf{siena08}
estimates the mean $\mu_\theta$
and the variance $\sigma^2_\theta$ of the distribution of $\theta$,
and tests several hypotheses concerning these `meta-parameters':
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test $H_0^{(0)}:\ \mu_\theta = \sigma^2_\theta = 0$
                       (all $\theta_j = 0$),
                      i.e., effect $\theta$ is nil altogether.\\
      This is done by means of a chi-squared test statistic $T^2$
      with $N$ d.f.
\item Estimate  $\mu_\theta $.
\item Test $H_0^{(1)}:\ \mu_\theta = 0$.\\
      This is done by means of a standard normal test statistic
      $ t_{\mu_\theta}$,
      being the ratio of the estimate for $\mu_\theta $
      to its standard error.
\item Test $H_0^{(2)}:\ \sigma^2_\theta = 0$,
                     i.e., $\theta_j = \mu_\theta$ for all $j$. \\
      This is done by means of a chi-squared test statistic $Q$
      with $N-1$ d.f.
\item Estimate  $\sigma^2_\theta$ .
\end{enumerate}
Two approaches are followed and presented in the output.
The first is an iterative weighted least squares method based on
\citet{Cochran54} and \citet{SnijdersBaerveldt03}.
The second is a likelihood-based method under the assumption
of normal distributions: the estimators are maximum likelihood
estimators; the associated confidence intervals
are based on profile likelihoods, and therefore will be
asymmetric. The reported
$p$-values for the population mean (hypothesis $H_0^{(1)}$)
are based on the $t$ distribution with $N-1$ d.f.
In all cases, it is possible that some of the data sets $j$ are
dropped for some of the parameters because the standard error $s_j$
is too large (see below);
in that case, the number $N$ used here
is the number of data sets actually used for the
parameter under consideration.

For both of these two approaches,
it is assumed that the true deviations $\theta_j - \theta$
and the random errors $E_j$ are uncorrelated.
This is not always a plausible assumption; Fisher's combination,
mentioned below, does not make this assumption.
The plots of estimates versus standard errors, produced
by using \textsf{siena08} and following it up by
\textsf{plot.sienaMeta}, can be used as information about the
plausibility of this assumption.

For testing the hypotheses mentioned here, it is also assumed that,
given the true parameter values $\theta_j$, the
estimates $\hat{\theta}_j$ are approximately normally distributed
with mean $\theta_j$ and variance $s^2_j$.
This is often a reasonable assumption.

The likelihood-based methods also assume that the true values
$\theta_j$ are normally distributed in the population.
If this is a reasonable approach, the likelihood-based methods
are preferable.
A disadvantage of the iterative weighted least squares method
is that results are possible
where the outcome of the test of $H_0^{(2)}$ is significant
at a usual level of significance,
i.e., $\sigma^2_\theta$ is thought to be positive, whereas
the estimate is $\hat\sigma^2_\theta = 0$.
This  potential inconsistency is possible because the test
and the estimator in this approach are not directly related
\citep[cf.][]{SnijdersBaerveldt03}.
The likelihood-based method does not suffer from this problem
because the maximum likelihood estimate always is contained
in the confidence interval based on the profile likelihood.
\bigskip

There may be reasons to distrust the estimates which are
large with also a large standard error. (This is known as the Donner-Hauck
phenomenon in logistic regression, discussed in
Section~\ref{S_fixingparameters}.)
Unfortunately, it is impossible to say in
general what is to be regarded as a large standard error.
A threshold of 4 or 5 for the standard error often is reasonable
for most effects; if a tested
parameter has a standard error larger than 4, then it is advisable to redo
the analysis in a specification where this parameter only is fixed to 0 and a
score test is carried out for this parameter. However, for some effects, in
any case for the `average similarity' effect for behavior dynamics,
parameters and standard errors tend to be larger, and a larger threshold
(e.g. 10) is appropriate. The same holds for effects of covariates with small
variances (less than .1).

An alternative, probably better, for the estimation of standard errors
is by using a non-parametric bootstrap confidence interval. For example, the
adjusted percentile ($BC_a$) method
\citep[][Chapter 5]{Efron1987,DavisonHinkley1997}
which is available in function \textsf{boot.ci} in \R package \textsf{boot}.


\subsubsection{Meta-analysis directed at testing the parameters}

Another method for combining the various data sets,
which does not make the assumption
that the parameters are a sample from a population and also
makes no assumptions of absence of correlation\footnote{This correlation
is defined for the population of networks, and if the population
does not exist then also the correlation is not defined.}
between the true deviations $\theta_j - \theta$
and the random errors $E_j$,
is based on Fisher's method for combining independent $p$-values;
the principle of this combination method of \citet{Fisher32} is described in
\citet{HedgesOlkin85}    and (briefly) in \citet[Chapter 3]{SnijdersBosker12}.

This principle here is applied in a double test:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for detecting if there are any networks with a positive parameter value,
         the null hypothesis tested is\\
       $H_0 :$   For all networks, the value of this parameter
            is zero or less than zero;\\
            with the alternative hypothesis;\\
        $H_1 :$
             For at least one network, the value of this parameter
             is greater than zero;
\item for detecting if there are any networks with a negative parameter value,
         the null hypothesis tested is\\
            $H_0 :$ For all networks, the value of this parameter
                  is zero or greater than zero;\\
            with the alternative hypothesis\\
            $H_1 :$ For at least one network, the value of this parameter
                   is less than zero.
\end{enumerate}
      For each of these combined tests, the $p$-value is given.
      In the output these are denoted, respectively,
      as `combination of right one-sided $p$-values' and
      `combination of left one-sided $p$-values'.

      It is advisable to use for each the significance level of $\alpha/2$
      (e.g., 0.025 if $\alpha = 0.05$) which yields an overall combined test
      at significance level $\alpha$.
      Note that four different overall results are possible.
      Indicating the right-sided and the left-sided $p$-values
      by $p_r$ and $p_l$,
      respectively, these possible results are:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\emph{\alph*})] % package enumitem
         \item $p_r >   \alpha/2, \  p_l >   \alpha/2$:\\
         No evidence for any nonzero parameter values;
         \item $p_r \leq \alpha/2, \ p_l >   \alpha/2$:\\
         Evidence that some networks have a positive parameter value,
         no evidence for any negative parameter values;
         \item $p_r >   \alpha/2, \ p_l \leq \alpha/2$:\\
         Evidence that some networks have a negative parameter value,
         no evidence for any positive parameter values;
         \item $p_r \leq \alpha/2, \ p_l \leq \alpha/2$:\\
         Evidence that some networks have a negative parameter value,
         and some others have a positive parameter value.
\end{enumerate}
      If all networks have a zero true parameter value,
      i.e., under the combined null hypothesis that
      $\theta_j = 0$  for all $j$,
      the probability of result (1) is less than or equal to $\alpha$;
      this is the way in which this combined test respects the
      overall probability of an error of the first kind.

\iffalse

The result of the score test can be added as follows to the
Fisher-combination results of Siena08:
<ol>
<li> if the one-step estimate is positive, calculate
     c_r = -2*ln(0.5*p) and c_l = -2*ln(1 - 0.5*p)
     where p is the $p$-value obtained for the score test;<br>

     (the "*" symbol denotes multiplication)<br>
     (it may be noted that these are chi-squared values with d.f. = 2);
<li> if the one-step estimate is negative, calculate
     c_r = -2*ln(1.0 - 0.5*p) and c_l = -2*ln(0.5*p)
     where p is the $p$-value obtained for the score test;
<li> add c_r to the right-sided chi-squared value
     and c_l to the left-sided chi-square value reported by Siena08;
<li> these are again chi-squared values, but the degrees of freedom
     are 2 higher.
</ol>
A disadvantage of this procedure is that if there are two or more
tested parameters having large standard errors, this procedure
including the estimation
must be carried out SEPARATELY for each tested parameter,
because in testing each parameter
you wish to control for all other effects and therefore not fix any other
effects to 0.

\subsubsection{Contrast between the two kinds of meta-analysis }

To understand the contrast between the method following the Cochran approach
for inference about a population of networks,
and the Fisher approach for combining independent tests, the following
may be helpful.
Inferring about a population always adds some uncertainty;
this is more serious when the sample size (here: number of combined networks)
is smaller.
In the extreme case, consider the combination of $N=2$ networks,
with estimates $\hat\theta_1 = 1$, standard error $s_1 = 0.1$,
and $\hat\theta_2 = 5, s_2 = 0.1$.
Then for both of the groups the $t$-statistic $\hat\theta_j/s_j$ is very large,
leading to the conclusion that parameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$
are very likely to be positive.
This will lead to a significant result for Fisher's combination of tests.
On the other hand, the mean in the population of networks, given that
there is available a sample of size as low as $N=2$, cannot be determined with
any degree of precision, so the confidence interval for this mean $\mu_\theta$
will be huge, and the result for testing the null hypothesis
$H_0^{(1)}$ will not be significant.
However, the results for testing $H_0^{(0)}$ and $H_0^{(2)}$
will be significant.


\subsection{Random coefficient multilevel Siena analysis}
\label{S_sienaBayes}

  The function \textsf{sienaBayes} is for Bayesian estimation of one group or
  of multiple groups all having the same number of waves and the same
  model specification.
  It is available in package \MS (see the \SI website).
  The methodology is explained in \citet{KoskinenSnijders2023}.
  The parameters -- excepting the basic rate parameters -- can be either
  randomly varying between groups according to a multivariate
  normal distribution, or non-varying and constant across groups.
  (Note that the term `non-varying' here does not mean that parameters
  are fixed, only that they do not vary \underline{between groups}.)
  The difference is made by setting the keyword \texttt{random} in
  the function \sfn{setEffect}. The default is that only the out-degree (density)
  effect is randomly varying, but it is advisable to specify
  this for a larger set of effects.
  Specifying it for too many effects may, however, lead to unstable estimation.

  The analysis is done by a Bayesian estimation method.
  This contrasts with the other functions in \rs, which are based on the
  frequentist approach to statistical inference.
  There are many introductions to Bayesian inference and textbooks; see e.g.,
  \citet{KaplanDepaoli2013,Gill2015,DonovanMickey2019}.
  \medskip

  The operation of \textsf{sienaBayes} is explained in this section,
  and also in \url{https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/sienaBayes_s.pdf}.

  For the groupwise parameters normal distributions are assumed with conjugate
  priors. The prior distribution for the basic rate parameters is determined
  in a data-dependent way. For the non-varying parameters,
  the default is to assume a flat prior.

  The procedure consists of three parts: initialization, warming,
  main phase.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
  In the initialization phase, initial parameter values and the proposal
  covariance matrix for Metropolis-Hastings (`MH') steps for groupwise parameters
  are obtained.
  This initialization has four parts.\\
  First, Method of Moments estimation of a parameter vector
  assumed to be the same across the groups (in a multi-group estimation),
  with step size \texttt{initgainGlobal}.
  This can be replaced by a run of \textsf{siena07} outside of \textsf{sienaBayes},
  and giving the results of this run to \textsf{sienaBayes}
  as the \texttt{prevAns} parameter.\\
  The second part, if \texttt{initgainGroupwise} is greater than 0,
  is one subphase of the Robbins-Monro algorithm for Method of
  Moments estimates for each group separately, with step size
  \texttt{initgainGroupwise}.
  Special precautions are taken here for dealing with group-level monadic variables,
  to prevent the issues that arise with such variables in normal use of \textsf{siena07}.\\
  Third, \texttt{nprewarm} pre-warming steps are taken. These are MH steps where the
  proposal covariance matrices are used directly (i.e., without scaling)
  for random walk proposals. Prewarming is stopped when too few
  acceptances are observed.\\
  The fourth part of the initialization scales
  the proposal covariance matrices, in the
  function \sfn{improveMH}, to achieve about 25 out of 100 acceptances of
  Bayes proposals after single MH steps.
  \item
  After initialization and scaling of the proposal covariance matrices,
  a warming phase is done of \sfn{nwarm} Bayesian proposals
  each with a number of MH steps, followed again by the function \sfn{improveMH}.
  \item
  Finally \texttt{nmain} repeats of \Big\{\texttt{nrunMHBatches} repeats of a
  number of MH steps sampling chains (the `inner loop'),
  plus \texttt{nSampVarying} MH steps
  sampling the varying parameters ($\theta_j$) plus \texttt{nSampConst} MH steps
  sampling the non-varying parameters ($\eta$) plus one Gibbs
  step sampling the global mean and covariance matrix of the varying parameters
  ($\mu$ and $\Sigma$)\Big\} are performed.
  In the warming as well as the final phase,
  the number of MH steps in the inner loop is
  determined by parameter \texttt{mult} (`multiplication factor')
  in the call of \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate} that created the algorithm object.
\end{enumerate}
  The function \textsf{sienaBayes} is time-consuming. When starting to use it, it is advisable
  to start with low values of \texttt{nmain} to explore computing time.
  When the procedure seems to diverge, and for very small groups, it is
  advisable to use smaller values of the parameters \texttt{initgainGlobal}
  and \texttt{initgainGroupwise}; and perhaps \texttt{reductionFactor}.


\subsubsection{Which data sets to use for sienaBayes}
\label{S_sBData}

\textsf{sienaBayes} uses as data set a \sfn{sienaGroup} object with 2 or more groups.
The number of waves should be the same for all groups.

The following data configurations are not allowed for groups
included in \textsf{sienaBayes} estimation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item tie variables in two consecutive waves changing from
    structural zero (code 10) to 1;
\item tie variables in two consecutive waves changing from
    structural one (code 11) to 0;
\item tie variables in three consecutive waves changing from
    structural zero (code 10) to \texttt{NA} to 1;
\item tie variables in three consecutive waves changing from
    structural one (code 11) to \texttt{NA} to 0;
\item and, for more than three consecutive waves, similar patterns
    with more NAs in between.
\end{enumerate}
To use data sets including such patterns for \textsf{sienaBayes},
you will have to make minimal changes to the data set
so as to avoid these patterns.
For example, replace sequences 10-1 by \texttt{NA}-1,
and 10-\texttt{NA}-1 by \texttt{NA}-\texttt{NA}-1.
An example script to make such replacements is at
{\small{\url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/changeForbiddenChanges.R}}}.

In addition to what is or is not allowed as data sets for \textsf{sienaBayes},
it is important to mention that using structural zeros to indicate
intermittent absence of actors (i.e., structural zeros \underline{only} at the beginning
or  \underline{only} at the end of a period) is not a good idea
for \textsf{sienaBayes}.
Tie variables that are 0 or 1 at the beginning of a wave and
structurally zero (code 10) at the end of the wave, have to assume
the value 0 at the end of the period; and this is used as information
for the estimation in \textsf{sienaBayes} of the parameters.
Probably by such a structural zero you wish to convey the meaning that the value
of this tie variable is unknown.
If there are two waves of data, the simple solution is to replace
all structural zeros for wave 2 by missing values (i.e., \texttt{NA}).
There is no straightforward solution if there are three or more waves.
\medskip

\textsf{sienaBayes} should be possible for groups as small as 5 actors.
A restriction (maybe to be lifted later) is that the networks must not be
empty at any wave; and consecutive waves of networks must not be identical
(in other words, all Jaccard indices should be strictly less than 1).
\index{Jaccard index}

Be prepared for long computation times. The reason is that likelihood-based
computations are used (as distinct from the Method of Moments approach).
If all individual groups have enough information for good estimation by
the Method of Moments according to the intended model,
the use of \sfn{siena07} with the (default) Method of Moments, followed by a
meta-analysis by means of \sfn{siena08} or \sfn{metafor}, may be preferable.

It is advisable to first do a multi-group analysis of the same model,
followed by a \textsf{sienaTimeTest}, to get an initial understanding of where problems
might occur. You may then later use the result for the \texttt{prevAns}
parameter of \textsf{sienaBayes}.


\subsubsection{Model specification}

Non-constant rate functions currently are not supported in \textsf{sienaBayes}.

The extra part of model specification for \textsf{sienaBayes},
compared to \textsf{siena07},
is that it is required to specify which parameters are
randomly varying from group to group, and which are fixed across groups.
The specification of fixed vs.\ randomly varying
for the other parameters is done in the function
\textsf{setEffect}, by its parameter \texttt{random}.
To be able to see which of the effects are specified in this way,
please have a look at the help page for \sfn{print.sienaEffects}:
\begin{verbatim}
?print.sienaEffects
\end{verbatim}
and note the parameters \texttt{includeRandoms}
and \texttt{dropRates}, which are helpful especially for
random coefficient multilevel modeling.
Requesting \texttt{includeRandoms = TRUE} will show the column indicating
which effects are random; \texttt{dropRates = TRUE} omits the
rows with rate effects, which can be a lot of superfluous information
that perhaps you do not want to see.

The exception to the rate parameters being always randomly varying
is that they may be fixed --- in which case all of them need to be fixed,
and input parameter \\
\texttt{priorRatesFromData} needs to be set to --2.
\medskip

There currently is little advice about which effects to specify
as randomly varying.
The basic issues are the following.
\begin{description}
\item[\emph{interest:}] is variability of the effect across groups
   a primary part of the research question?\\
   (Usually not; such research questions about variability
   are of a quite secondary nature.)
\item[\emph{knowledge:}] is there prior knowledge about whether
   effects differ between groups?\\
   (Usually not. It is possible to first do a multi-group analysis of the same model,
   followed by a \textsf{sienaTimeTest}, and specify those effects as randomly
   varying for which the time heterogeneity is largest according to the
   groupwise results.)
\item[\emph{misspecification:}] if it would be erroneously assumed
    that the effect is fixed across groups, would this affect
    the parameter estimates of primary interest?\\
    (About this we have little general knowledge; it can be tried out
    by running estimations for different specifications of this
    part of the model.)
\item[\emph{convergence:}] specifying effects as random will
    influence convergence. Up to a point, randomly varying parameters
    will have better convergence properties than fixed parameters;
    but if their number is too large, given the number of groups,
    convergence can deteriorate again.
    This may then lead to outliers in the posterior means,
    which can be diagnosed by function \sfn{plotPostMeansMDS}.
\item[\emph{amount of information:}] which specification will
     use the information in the data most efficiently?\\
     (Here finally we do have a provisional answer. Assuming that an effect is fixed
     across groups will give a smaller uncertainty ---posterior standard
     deviation, interpreted as standard error--- in the estimated parameter
     than assuming it varies randomly;
     cf.\ Section~\ref{S_sienaBayesInterpret}.
     This will be the more so as the number of
     groups is smaller. Therefore, for the coefficients for which
     there is no strong prior knowledge that they are variable across groups,
     and which are tested as a primary issue for answering the research question,
     from the point of view of statistical power
     it is advisable to specify that they are fixed.)
\end{description}


\subsubsection{How to enter your data in sienaBayes}

See the example at the bottom of the \textsf{sienaBayes} help page for how a
\sfn{sienaGroup} object can be created and used.
If some but not all of the Siena data objects combined in the \sfn{sienaGroup} have
periods where changes are only upward or only downward,
it will be necessary to use \texttt{allowOnly = FALSE} in the call of
\textsf{sienaDependent}; see the help page for \textsf{sienaDependent}.
The scripts \texttt{RscriptListGroups.R} and \texttt{RscriptMultipleGroups.R}
give further examples and explanation for creating \sfn{sienaGroup} objects.

If you have a large number of groups (more than 30), try first
with a smaller number of groups (10-20). If you need or wish to
make a selection of groups, select the one with few or no missing data and
with Jaccard coefficients at least 0.30.\index{Jaccard index}

\subsubsection{How to choose the parameter settings for sienaBayes}
\label{S_sienaBayesParameters}

It is good to have an initial estimation as a multi-group estimation
using the Method of Moments, i.e., using \textsf{siena07}, with
an algorithm having
\texttt{nsub = 2} and a reduced value of \texttt{firstg}, e.g.,
0.05 or less, and look at these results --
they will give you a rough idea even if they are nowhere near convergence.
If some of the estimated non-rate parameters are very large
in absolute value, use a smaller value of \texttt{firstg}, such as 0.01 or 0.001.
This result of  \textsf{siena07} can then be given as the \texttt{prevAns}
parameter to \textsf{sienaBayes} (see the help page).
Note that the parameter \texttt{firstg} corresponds to \texttt{initgainGlobal}
of \textsf{sienaBayes}, if no  \texttt{prevAns} is used.

It may be good to have an initial try run with\\
\texttt{nwarm = 5, nmain = 10, nrunMHBatches = 5, nImproveMH = 20}
(for speed) \\
and \\
\texttt{silentstart = FALSE} (for information about the
initialization phase),\\
and then \textsf{print}the result.
This will give information about the results of the initialization
phase and about computing time. If some of the groups have some very
high estimated rate parameters, you should either drop those groups
or decrease the value of \texttt{initgainGroupwise}.
The new value could be, e.g., 0.005 or 0.001 or 0.0. With the lower value
of \texttt{initgainGroupwise}, dropping the groups concerned may be unnecessary,
so don't drop groups too soon.

For normal use, \texttt{nwarm = 500, nmain = 1000, nrunMHBatches = 20, nImproveMH = 100}
may be reasonable.
Computing time is roughly proportional to
\texttt{nmain $\times$ nrunMHBatches}.
We still have to develop guidelines about how to choose the number of
iterations. If the tracelines show that the process is still quite
unstable even in the later part of the runs, possibilities are to
increase \texttt{nrunMHBatches} but also to increase the \texttt{mult} parameter in
\textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}. Increasing these will for both of them lead to
a proportional increase in computing time.

If multiple processors are available (which most computers have nowadays),
you can make more speed by setting the \texttt{nbrNodes} parameter to a value
larger than 1. Since parallelization goes by period $\times$ group,
it is nice, but not necessary, to have a value for \texttt{nbrNodes} that
is a divisor of (the number of periods multiplied by the number of groups);
higher values are meaningless.
Do not use such a high value for \texttt{nbrNodes} that your computer gets too
 hot or overworked. For Windows machines this can be monitored by opening
 the Task Manager (you will find how to do this by right clicking on the bottom
 toolbar).

\subsubsection{Prior distributions}

The prior mean and prior variance need to be given for the vector of parameters
that are randomly varying between the groups.
These are the rate parameters and the parameters specified with
\begin{verbatim}
random = TRUE
\end{verbatim}
in the call of \texttt{setEffect}.
For an effects object called \texttt{myeff}, you can see which
parameters are specified as randomly varying by
\begin{verbatim}
print(myeff, includeRandoms = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
This will also tell you the number of random effects, which are the
dimensions for the parameters \texttt{priorMu} and  \texttt{priorSigma}
used to specify the prior distribution.
The rate parameters can be dropped from the \texttt{print} result
by requesting
\begin{verbatim}
print(myeff, includeRandoms = TRUE, dropRates = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
The list and order of only the randomly varying effects
can be shown by requesting
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
myeff[(myeff$randomEffects | (myeff$basicRate & (myeff$group==1) )) & myeff$include, ]
\end{verbatim}
}

\noindent
The list and order of only the non-varying effects
can be shown by requesting
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
myeff[myeff$include & (!myeff$basicRate) & (!myeff$randomEffects),]
\end{verbatim}
}
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Non-varying parameters}
\smallskip

For the non-varying parameters ($\eta$, the greek letter `eta'),
by default an improper flat prior is used,
and nothing needs to be specified by the user.
\smallskip

However, there is the possibility to specify normal priors
with mean 0 and a given variance. This can be useful for effects
of group-level variables. The prior variances of the non-varying parameters
are given by the parameter \texttt{priorSigEta}.
This needs to be a vector with length equal to the number of
non-varying parameters.
Values \texttt{NA} indicate that a flat prior should be used
(which can be interpreted as an infinite variance).
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Varying parameters}
\smallskip

\noindent
The population distribution of the randomly varying parameters
is assumed to be multivariate normal $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$.
The conjugate prior for the multivariate normal distribution is used
to reflect the prior uncertainty in the parameters $\mu$ and $\Sigma$;
cf.\ \citet[][Section 3.6]{BDA3} and \citet[][Chapter 14]{HaganForster2004}.
This conjugate prior is the inverse Wishart distribution for $\Sigma$;
and, conditional on $\Sigma$, for $\mu$ a multivariate normal distribution,
specified as follows:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \Sigma \, & \sim \,
    \mathrm{InvWishart}_{{p_1}}(\Lambda_0^{-1},\nu_0) \, ,
    \text{ and conditionally on }  \Sigma \\
   \mu \, & \mid \, \Sigma \sim \mathcal{N}_{p_1}(\mu_0, \Sigma/\kappa_0) \, .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Thus, the parameters of the prior are $\nu_0$, $\Lambda_0$, $\mu_0$,
and $\kappa_0$.
These are specified for \textsf{sienaBayes} in \RS in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\nu_0$ = \texttt{priorDf};
  \item  $\Lambda_0 = \mathtt{priorDf} \times \mathtt{priorSigma}$;
  \item  $\mu_0$ = \texttt{priorMu};
  \item $\kappa_0$ = \texttt{priorKappa}.
\end{itemize}
This means the following for the prior parameters as
specified for \textsf{sienaBayes}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  \texttt{priorDf} can be regarded as the
        effective sample size that has led to the prior information.
        For mathematical reasons, this must be at least $p+2$, where
        $p$ is the number of varying parameters.
  \item  \texttt{priorSigma} is your prior guess for the population
        covariance matrix of the varying parameters; in other words,
        this reflects the differences that may exist between the groups.
  \item  \texttt{priorMu} is your prior guess for the population mean $\mu$ of
       the varying parameters.
  \item \texttt{priorSigma / priorKappa} reflects your uncertainty
       about your guess for $\mu$.
\end{itemize}
It is quite a restriction that the covariance matrix expressing the prior
uncertainty about $\mu$ should be proportional to the population
(i.e., `true between-group') covariance matrix of the varying parameters.
This is a mathematical consequence of the use of the conjugate prior.
Often, the prior uncertainty about $\mu$ will be greater than the
assumed between-group differences, leading to a choice of \texttt{priorKappa}
less than 1, e.g., 0.01; note that \texttt{priorKappa} is a ratio
of variances, and the ratio of uncertainties will be better
expressed by its square root.

More research is needed for advice about prior distributions.
Especially for small numbers of groups, the priors may have a strong influence.
\medskip

The prior mean of the varying parameters,
\texttt{priorMu}, is a vector of length equal to the number of varying parameters.
In the object produced by \textsf{sienaBayes}, let us call it \texttt{ans},
this length is stored as \texttt{ans\$p1}.
For example, in a model with 4 waves, one dependent network variable,
and varying parameters specified for outdegree, reciprocity,
transitive ties, and similarity for some covariate $V$,
the length would be 3+4=7 (3 for three periods +
4 for four varying parameters).
The prior covariance matrix of the varying parameters,
\texttt{priorSigma}, is a symmetric square matrix of dimension
equal to the length of \texttt{priorMu}.

The treatment of these prior distributions
should distinguish between the rate parameters and the parameters for the
objective function.
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Rate parameters}
\smallskip

\noindent
If rate parameters are fixed (an exceptional case), they are
not included in the prior.

In other cases, special attention must be given to the rate parameters.
Sometimes, for small groups and complicated models, some of the
rate parameters may be estimated in the multi-group option by very high
numbers. This may be the case especially for groups with low Jaccard
\index{Jaccard index}
coefficients, or for groups that deviate strongly from the other groups.
It may be advisable to take out the groups with extremely high
rate parameters (e.g., larger than 50 or 80).
To make it feasible to try and include some groups with high estimated rate
parameters, a stronger prior distribution for these parameters may be employed.

By default, the prior for the basic rate parameters is data-dependent,
with a mean and covariance matrix that are robust estimates
based on the estimated rate parameters from the initialization phase.
This mostly will be adequate.

To have explicit control of the prior for the basic rate parameters,
the data dependence can be turned off by using
\texttt{priorRatesFromData = 0}.
Then the choice for \texttt{priorMu} and \texttt{priorSigma}
is going to matter.
Consider the rate parameters as estimated in the multi-group analysis
of the same data set.
Suppose the total number of groups is $N$.
For each separate rate parameter (for a given wave
and for a given dependent variable) there then are $N$ estimates,
some of which may be too high; denote the average and the variance
of the subset of not-too-high values by $m$ and $s^2$, respectively.
These are specific for the  given wave and the given dependent variable.
These values for mean and variance should
represent what one might find plausible values for this rate parameter.

The corresponding elements of \texttt{priorMu} and diagonal elements
of \texttt{priorSigma} should be then set, respectively, to values
close to these $m$ and $s^2$.

As an example, suppose there are $N = 20$ groups, 3 waves and one dependent
variable (a network), and 5 varying parameters in addition to the rate parameters.
Then \texttt{p1} = 2+5 = 7.
Suppose that for the rate parameters the default
data-dependent prior is used (\texttt{priorRatesFromData = 2}).
Then in the parameters \texttt{priorMu} and \texttt{priorSigma}
it still is necessary to include the prior rate parameters,
to have the correct dimensionality of this vector and matrix,
but their values do not matter.
Suppose further that for the parameters of the objective function
the prior mean for the density parameter is specified as $-1$,
for the reciprocity parameter as $+1$,
all other prior means as $0$, and all prior between-group variances as $1$.
Further assume that the prior uncertainty about $\mu$ is thought to be
10~times larger, on the variance scale, than the prior between-group differences.
One then could use the following piece of code.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
m7 <- c(5, 5, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
S7 <- matrix(0, 7, 7)
diag(S7) <- 0.01
ans <- sienaBayes(...., priorMu = m7, priorSigma = S7, priorDf = 22, priorKappa = 0.01,
                  priorRatesFromData = 2, ....)
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
\texttt{priorDf} is the prior degrees of freedom for the
covariance matrix. It can be interpreted as the sample size on which,
hypothetically, the prior knowledge about the covariance matrix of the
parameters is based.
The influence of the prior on the results is larger when \texttt{priorDf}
is larger.
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Parameters of the objective function}
\smallskip

\noindent
For parameters of the objective function, it will be usually be possible
to use some prior knowledge, together with neutrality with respect to
the sign of tested parameters (in order not to unduly bias results.)
In most cases the outdegree parameter is expected to be negative and
the reciprocity parameter positive. The researcher should consider
earlier studies of similar network dynamics; reasonable values for the
prior mean for the outdegree parameter might be --2 or --1, and for the
reciprocity parameter +1.5 or +2. For homophily parameters on important
attributes expressed by the \texttt{simX} effect (which is standardized),
as long as these are regarded as control effects, one might specify the
prior mean conservatively as 0.3 or 0.5.
\iffalse
Since many \SI parameters are defined in such a way that they have values
in the range between --1 and +1, a prior variance in the range from 0.02 to
0.5 would often be reasonable; but it will be good to consider earlier
studies to have a good grounding for this choice.
\fi

Continuing the example above, if the 5 varying non-rate parameters would
start with an outdegree and a reciprocity parameter, the prior means
could be modified, e.g., to
\begin{verbatim}
m7 <- c(5, 5, -2, 1.5, 0, 0, 0)
\end{verbatim}
(if for the similarity parameters also the value of 0 is used...).
% S7 <- matrix(0, 7, 7)
% diag(S7) <- c(2, 2, 1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1)


\subsubsection{Operation of \textsf{sienaBayes}}

In Section \ref{S_sienaBayesParameters} it was already suggested to
start with a run with very low values of the sample size settings for the
MCMC procedure.

It is advisable to use multiple processes (`parallel computing') for
\textsf{sienaBayes}; see Section~\ref{S_multipleProcesses} where it is explained
that parallelization is different for \textsf{sienaBayes} than for MoM
estimation by \textsf{siena07}.

When the procedure has made a good start but the MCMC sample seems too
short, you can make a prolonged analysis using the \texttt{prevBayes} option,
and then combine the earlier with the later results using \sfn{glueBayes}.
This is illustrated in the example on the help page.

During operation of \sfn{sienaBayes}, partial results of the function
are now and then stored
as objects named \texttt{z} in files with the name
\texttt{PartialBayesResult.RData}; see the help page.
This is for the case that the computer or \R stops inadvertently
during the long computations.
These are \sfn{sienaBayesFit} objects, and therefore can be used in the
\textsf{print}and \textsf{summary} functions; they also can be used for
the \texttt{prevBayes} option to continue estimation.

\subsubsection{Assessing convergence}

You can visually inspect convergence by looking at the tracelines of the
various parameters. These can be plotted by the functions in \texttt{BayesPlots.r}
(available from the Siena website). In many cases, the tracelines for
the rate parameters already tell the story about convergence.

The file \texttt{BayesPlots.r} contains a variety of plotting functions that
can be used to obtain trace plots and posterior density plots.

The parameters \texttt{nwarm} and \texttt{nmain} in the call of
\textsf{sienaBayes} only imply
that an extra \sfn{improveMH} step is made between the warming and the
main iterations; there are no other differences between the warming
and main iterations. It is possible that convergence has set in only
later; depending on the case, the traceplots may give information about this.
If you conclude that convergence has occurred later, then use this to
define the \texttt{nfirst} parameter in the \textsf{print}and
\textsf{summary} functions for
\sfn{sienaBayesFit} object (see \texttt{?print.sienaBayesFit}).

When the procedure seems to have diverged and this occurs right
from the start, it is
advisable to use smaller values of the parameters \texttt{initgainGlobal}
and \texttt{initgainGroupwise}.
If divergence sets in later and is most pronounced
for the rate parameters, it may be advisable to use a smaller value of
\texttt{reductionFactor}, e.g., 0.1.
If generally the tracelines are irregular, it may be good to increase
\texttt{nrunMHBatches} but another possibility is to increase
the \texttt{mult} parameter set in \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.

\iffalse
A way to get estimates from overdispersed starting points and not
run the whole \texttt{improveMH} over and over again is to use \texttt{prevBayes},
with an object in which \texttt{thetaMat} is changed to new initial values.
Then the proposal covariance matrices etc. will be retained,
so the transition distribution of the MCMC process remains the same but
only the starting values are different.
\fi
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Using other packages for convergence assessment}
\smallskip

\noindent
The advice of literature such as \citet{BDA3} is to use multiple
sequences produced independently, preferably from overdispersed
starting points, for assessing convergence.
For example, one may use 3 to 5 such sequences.
Function \sfn{extract.sienaBayes} can be used to extract
from these sequences the draws from the posterior distributions
of the parameters of interest.
This function produces a three-dimensional array of
iterations by chains by parameters, which then can be used, e.g., in
function \sfn{monitor} of package \sfn{rstan} or with the
help of package \sfn{coda}.

Currently there is no good way in \sfn{sienaBayes} to use
overdispersed starting points. (The difficulty is to get overdispersion
while still retaining a reasonable convergence for each sequence.)
The best option currently is to use independent restarts of the whole
algorithm; or to use one MoM estimation run as the basic starting
point, and use that as \texttt{prevAns} parameter in several independent
restarts, and perhaps continuations after this using \texttt{prevBayes}.
Note that `independence' is obtained by using different random
number seeds in the \texttt{sienaAlgorithm}; and that this is implied
by its default value \texttt{NULL}.

Function \sfn{monitor} gives information about the potential
scale reduction $\hat R$ of the posterior distribution if simulations
were continued indefinitely, and the effective sample size
$n_{\text{\scriptsize eff}}$ (i.e., the estimated equivalent
sample size under independent sampling).
Rules of thumb given in \citet[][p. 287]{BDA3} are that,
for all parameters of interest,
$\hat R \leq 1.1$ and $n_{\text{\scriptsize eff}} \geq 5m$,
where $m$ is the number of chains.

Note that what is given by \sfn{monitor} as the
`\texttt{se\_mean}' is the standard error of the mean
of the posterior distribution as an estimator for
the global mean $\mu_i$: i.e., this expresses the uncertainty
due to the finite length of the MCMC chain, it is not
a measure of spread of the posterior distribution itself.


\subsubsection{Interpreting results of sienaBayes}
\label{S_sienaBayesInterpret}

The \textsf{print}and \textsf{summary} functions
give posterior means, posterior standard deviations, 95\% credibility intervals,
and one-sided posterior $p$-values
for testing whether the parameter is positive or negative.
These are the Bayesian versions of estimates, standard errors,
confidence intervals, and $p$-values.
These functions can be used with a parameter \texttt{nfirst}, indicating
the first iterations from which convergence is assumed.
The default value is the number of warming iterations~+~1,
but this may be inadequate. From the trace plots obtained by
functions in script  \texttt{BayesPlots.r} is may be possible
to make an improved guess for this iteration number,
and use this for \texttt{nfirst}.

The function \textsf{siena.table} can be used also for making
\texttt{html} or \LaTeX\ tables of the results for the global parameters;
here again, the parameter \texttt{nfirst} may be used.

The functions \sfn{simpleBayesTest} and \sfn{multipleBayesTest}
are available for testing parameters; see the help page for these functions.
To compute further properties of the sample of the posterior,
the components
\texttt{ThinParameters, ThinPosteriorMu, \\
ThinPosteriorEta}, and \texttt{ThinPosteriorSigma} of the
\sfn{sienaBayesFit} object, as mentioned in the help page, may be useful.

The file \texttt{BayesPlots.r}, mentioned above, contains some plotting
functions that are useful for making posterior density plots.

The function \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans} can be used to obtain
posterior means and standard deviations of the groupwise estimated
parameters. These are like the `\emph{empirical Bayes}' estimates
known also from other statistical models.
A multi-dimensional scaling (`MDS') plot of the posterior means
can be obtained from the function \\
\sfn{plotPostMeansMDS}.
This is useful especially for detecting outliers.
If strong outliers are found, this may have two different reasons:
truly deviating groups; or instability of the estimation
of the posterior means, related perhaps to having too many
randomly varying parameters.
In the latter case, it may be quite arbitrary (in the sense of
`depending on the whim of the random numbers during the
operation of \textsf{sienaBayes}') which groups are
indicated in the plot as being the outliers.

It should be noted that due to the high correlations between parameters,
the posterior means may be useful mainly for model specifications
with a limited number of randomly varying parameters.
If one is interested, for example, in assessing differences
between groups with respect to reciprocation by comparing
posterior means for the reciprocity parameter, it should be avoided
to specify other parameters as randomly varying that are
highly correlated with the reciprocity parameter.

It should be noted that the \texttt{.txt} files produced by \sfn{sienaBayes}
are produced somewhere in the initial phase of the project and not meant
to be informative for final results. They contain the results of the
initial estimate by the multiple groups method and may be disregarded.
\medskip

When comparing results for specifications that differ with respect
to specifying the effects as fixed or varying across groups,
it will be noted that posterior standard deviations for the means
are larger when specifying the effects as randomly varying, as compared
to specifying them as fixed. This is natural, and it is associated
with a difference in interpretation.
Specifying the effect as randomly varying implies that there also is
an important step of generalization from the observed groups to the population
of groups. The between-group variance then is a priori unknown and one is
estimating a mean parameter from a sample of $N$ groups; usually $N$ is not
very large and the uncertainty about the between-group differences
will contribute considerably to the uncertainty of the population mean.

\section[Formulas for effects]{Mathematical definition of effects}
\label{S_math}

The list of all effects available for any data set is obtained by
the command
\begin{verbatim}
effectsDocumentation()
\end{verbatim}
which produces a html file.
For a given effects object, say with the name \texttt{myeff}, the command
\begin{verbatim}
effectsDocumentation(effects = myeff)
\end{verbatim}
will give a file with all effects implemented for this effects object.
See
\begin{verbatim}
?effectsDocumentation
\end{verbatim}
for further options.
\bigskip

This chapter present the mathematical formulae for the definition of the
effects. Further background to these formulae can be found
for network dynamics in \citet{Snijders01,Snijders05,SnijdersEA10b};
for network and behavior dynamics in the last reference and
\citet*{SteglichEA10}; and for co-evolution of multiple networks,
including two-mode networks, in \citet{SLT2013}.
The effects are grouped into effects for modelling network
evolution and effects for modelling behavioral evolution (i.e.,
the dynamics of dependent actor variables). Within each group of
effects, the effects are listed in the order in which they appear
in \si. The short name of the effect (\texttt{shortName}),
as it is specified in \RS is specified in brackets.


For two-mode (bipartite) networks, only a subset of the effects is
meaningful, since the first node set has only outgoing ties
and the second only incoming; for example, the reciprocity effect
is meaningless because there cannot be any reciprocal ties;
the out-degree popularity effect is meaningless because it refers to
incoming ties of actors with high out-degrees; and there are no direct
similarity effects of actor covariates. However, distance-two effects
such as \texttt{simEgoInDist2}, and the interaction of effects like
\texttt{altInDist2} with \texttt{egoX} can be used to represent
homophily-like tendencies.
There are some specific effects for two-mode networks, e.g.,
the four-cycle effect.

\hypertarget{T_effpar}{
Some of the effects contain a number which is denoted in this section
by $p$, and called in this manual an \emph{internal effect parameter}.
}
(These are totally different from the statistical parameters which are
the weights of the effects in the objective function.)
These are set or modified by the \texttt{setEffect} function, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
myeffects <- setEffect(myeffects, gwespFF, parameter = 69)
\end{verbatim}
%These numbers can be determined by the user
%by changing the \textsf{{\em pname}.mo} file
%described in Section~\ref{S_mo3file}.

\subsection{Network evolution}
The model of network evolution consists of the model of actors'
decisions to establish new ties or dissolve existing ties
(according to {\it evaluation}, {\it creation},
and {\it endowment functions}) and the
model of the timing of these decisions (according to the {\it rate
function}).
The model, and the roles played by these three functions,
were briefly explained in Section~\ref{S_defmod}.

For some effects
the creation and endowment functions are
implemented not for estimation by the Method of Moments
but only by the Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian method;
this is indicated below by `endowment effect only likelihood-based'.

(It may be noted that the network evaluation function
was called objective function,
and the creation and endowment functions were called gratification function,
in \citet{Snijders01}.)

\subsubsection{Network evaluation function}
\label{S_f}

The network evaluation function for actor $i$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
f^{\rm net}_i(x) \, = \,
              \sum_k \beta^{\rm net}_k s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)   \label{f_net}
\end{equation}
where $\beta^{\rm net}_k$ are parameters and $s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)$
are effects as defined below.
If the model also contains some elementary effects
(see Section~\ref{S_elementary}), the objective
function is the sum of this and
\begin{equation}
f^{\rm el}_i(x) \, = \,
              \sum_k \beta^{\rm el}_k s^{\rm el}_{ik}(x)  \ , \label{f_el_net}
\end{equation}
see Section~\ref{S_mathmod}.
Elementary effects are of the type $s^{\rm el}_{ijk}(x) = x_{ij}\,s^{\rm el0}_{ijk}(x)$,
where $s^{\rm el0}_{ijk}(x)$ does not depend on $x_{ij}$.


The potential effects in the \hypertarget{T_objective}{network
evaluation function}
are the following. Note that in all
effects where a constants $p$ occurs, this constant can be chosen
and changed by the user;
this is the internal effect parameter mentioned above,
which can be modified by the function \texttt{setEffect(..., parameter=..., ...)}.
\iffalse
Also note that the evaluation effects which
are a function only of the out-degree of actor $i$ are excluded for
Model Type 2.
\fi
For non-directed networks, the same formulae are used,
unless a different formula is given explicitly.
Some of the effects are dropped for non-directed networks, because
they are not meaningful; and some of the names differ in the
non-directed case.
Section~\ref{S_NonDirEff} gives some effects that are specific
to non-directed networks.
\medskip

\noindent
\textbf{\emph{Structural effects}}
\medskip

\noindent
Structural effects are the effects depending on the network only.
The following list also contains some elementary effects
(see Section~\ref{S_elementary}).
The type of the elementary effects in \RS still is \texttt{eval},
indicating that its parameter is applied both for creating new ties
and for maintaining existing ties.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item  \hypertarget{T_density}{{\em out-degree effect}} or
 \emph{density effect} \texttt{(density)},
 defined by the out-degree\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = x_{i+} = \sum_j x_{ij}$,\\
 where $x_{ij}=1$ indicates presence of a tie from $i$ to $j$
 while $x_{ij}=0$ indicates absence of this tie;

 \item  \hypertarget{T_reci}{{\em reciprocity effect}} \texttt{(recip)},
 defined by the number of reciprocated ties\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\,x_{ji}$;

 \begin{minipage}[t]{.75\textwidth}
  \item \hypertarget{T_transtrip}{{\em transitive triplets effect}}
 \texttt{(transTrip)},
   defined by the number of transitive
 patterns in $i$'s relations (ordered pairs of actors
 $(j,h)$ to both of whom $i$ is tied, while also $j$ is tied to $h$),\\
  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_{j, h} x_{ij}\, x_{ih}\, x_{hj}\,$;\\
 (there was an error here until version 3.313,
 which amounted to combining the transitive triplets and transitive
 mediated triplets effects;)

 \item {\em transitive ties effect} \texttt{(transTies)}
 (earlier called \emph{(direct and indirect ties) effect}),
 defined by
 the number of actors to whom $i$ is directly as well as indirectly tied, \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij} \, \max_h (x_{ih}\, x_{hj}) $;

 \item {\em betweenness count} \texttt{(between)},\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_{j, h} x_{hi}\, x_{ij}\, (1-x_{hj})\,$;\\
 note that this is one of the rare effects that depends on \underline{non-existence}
 of a tie (here, the tie $h \rightarrow j$); this makes it less attractive,
 use it only if you know what you are doing!

 \item {\em balance} \texttt{(balance)}, defined by the similarity between
 the outgoing ties of actor $i$ and the outgoing ties of the other actors
 $j$ to whom $i$ is tied,
 \[ s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij} \neqsum{h}{h}{i,j}
 \left( b_0 - \mid x_{ih} - x_{jh} \mid \right)\, , \]
 where $b_0$ is a constant included to reduce the correlation
 between this effect and the density effect,
 \hypertarget{T_meanbal}{defined by}
 \[ b_0 = \frac{1}{(M-1)n(n-1)(n-2)} \sum_{m=1}^{M-1}
 \sum_{i, j=1}^n \neqsum{h}{h}{i,j}
 \mid x_{ih}(t_m) - x_{jh}(t_m) \mid \,.\]
 This may also be regarded as \emph{structural equivalence
 with respect to outgoing ties}.
 (In \RS versions before 3.324, this was divided by $n-2$, which for larger
 networks tended to lead to quite large estimates and standard errors.
 Therefore in version 3.324, the division by $n-2$
 -- which had not always been there -- was dropped.)

\item {\em structural equivalence effect with respect to
      incoming ties} \texttt{(inStructEq)}, which is an analogue to the
      balance effect but now considering similarity with respect to incoming
      ties,
      \begin{subequations}
      \begin{equation}
      s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum x_{ij} d_{ij}
      \end{equation}
      with
      \begin{equation}
       d_{ij} =  \neqsum{h}{h}{i,j} \big(b_0 - \mid x_{hi} - x_{hj}\mid \big) \ .
%       =  (n-2)b_0 - \big( x_{+i}+x_{+j} -x_{ij}-x_{ji}-2\sum_h x_{hi}x_{hj} \big)
      \end{equation}
      \end{subequations}
      This effect is not quite finalized yet, because provisionally
      $b_0 = 0$ instead of a mean of the subtracted values like in the balance effect.
      Subtraction of the mean will lead to better convergence properties.

 \item {\em Jaccard similarity for outgoing ties effect} \texttt{(Jout)},
 an elementary effect defined by
 the Jaccard similarity with respect to outgoing ties,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij} \, J_{\text{out}}(i,j)$, where
 \[
 J_{\text{out}}(i,j) \,=\, \frac{\sum_h x_{ih}\,x_{jh}}
                     {x_{i+} + x_{j+} - \sum_h x_{ih}\,x_{jh}}
 \]
 (where 0/0 is taken as 0).

 \noindent
 Since the Jaccard measure has smaller variability than a lot of other
 effects, the parameter estimates of this will often be larger,
 with correspondingly larger standard errors,
 than many other parameter estimates. The same holds for
 the other Jaccard similarity effects.

 \item {\em Jaccard similarity for incoming ties effect} \texttt{(Jin)},
 an elementary effect defined by
 the Jaccard similarity with respect to incoming ties,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij} \, J_{\text{in}}(i,j)$, where
 \[
 J_{\text{in}}(i,j) \,=\, \frac{\sum_h x_{hi}\,x_{hj}}
                     {x_{+i} + x_{+j} - \sum_h x_{hi}\,x_{hj}}
 \]
 (where again 0/0 is taken as 0).

 \item {\em number of distances two effect} \texttt{(nbrDist2)},
 \hypertarget{T_dist2}{defined by}
 the number of actors to whom $i$ is indirectly tied
 (through at least one intermediary, i.e., at sociometric distance 2),\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \#\{j \mid x_{ij} = 0,\, \max_h (x_{ih}\, x_{hj}) > 0 \}$;\\
 endowment effect only likelihood-based because the Method of Moments
 estimators for endowment effects are based on the `loss' associated
 with terminated ties, and this cannot be straightforwardly applied
 for the number of distances two effect.\\
 This effect is difficult to interpret: actor $i$ can increase this effect by making a
 new tie to an actor $j$ at distance 2 but also by dropping a direct tie to an
 actor $j$ to whom $i$ is also connected via a two-path
 $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j$.
 Instead of this effect it may be preferable to use one of the many other
 effects representing closure (\texttt{transTrip}, \texttt{transTies},
 the various gwesp effects, the various Jaccard effects, etc.).

 \item {\em number of doubly achieved distances two effect} \texttt{(nbrDist2twice)},
 defined by
 the number of actors to whom $i$
 is not directly tied, and tied through twopaths via at least two intermediaries,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \#\{j \mid x_{ij} = 0,\, \sum_h (x_{ih}\, x_{hj}) \geq 2 \}$;\\
 evidently, this is even more difficult to interpret than \texttt{(nbrDist2)};
 both effects should be used if there are very specific
 and convincing reasons to include them in the model;\\
 endowment effect only likelihood-based;\\


 \item {\em number of dense triads} \texttt{(denseTriads)},
 defined as triads containing at least $p$ ties,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_{j,h} x_{ij} \, I\{ x_{ij}\, + x_{ji}\, + x_{ih}\, + x_{hi}\,
 + x_{jh}\, + x_{hj}\,)\geq p \}\,$,\\
 where the `indicator function' $I\{A\}$ is 1 if the condition
 $A$ is fulfilled and 0 otherwise, and where $p$ is either 5 or 6;\\
  (this effect is superfluous and undefined for symmetric networks);

 \item five variations of the \emph{GWESP (geometrically weighted edgewise
  shared partners)} effects: \texttt{gwespFF, gwespBB, gwespFB, gwespBF, gwespRR},
  and for non-directed $W$ networks the sixth version \texttt{gwesp}. \\
  \emph{Note that there is a difference since version 1.1-251; see at the end
  of this item.}

  These are effects like those developed for exponential random graph models (`ERGMs')
  by \citet{SPRH06}, in the parametrisation of \citet{Hunter2007}.
  The five versions relate to the various directionalities of the ties,
  just like the proposals for directed networks in \citet{RPW2009}.

  The \texttt{gwespFF} effect is an alternative expression for transitivity.
  This concept here is specified in an actor-based way,
  by counting configurations in the local neighbourhood of
  a given actor, rather than in the tie-oriented way of the
  models in the ERGM family, for which the GWESP statistic
  was first developed.
  The actor-based \texttt{gwespFF} effect is defined,
  in direct analogy to the corresponding global statistic
  of \citet{Hunter2007}, by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  \text{GWESPFF}(i, \alpha) \,=\,
      \sum_{k=1}^{n-2}  e^{\alpha} \,\big\{1 \,-\, \big(1 - e^{-\alpha}\big)^k  \big\}
      \, \text{EPFF}_{ik}   \ ,
         \label{GWESP}
\end{equation}
where $\text{EPFF}_{ik}$ (for `edgewise partners') is the number of nodes $j$
such that $i \rightarrow j$ and there are exactly $k$ other
nodes $h$ for which there is the two-path $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j$.

\caption{Geometrically weighted edgewise shared partners;
left, transitive (`gwespFF'); right, cyclical (`gwespBB');
for F=`forward', B=`backward'.}
\label{F_gwesp1}
\end{figure}

An equivalent way of writing this is
\begin{equation}
  \text{GWESPFF}(i, \alpha) \,=\,
       \sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij} \,
                        e^{\alpha} \,\Big\{1 \,-\, \big(1 -
                        e^{-\alpha}\big)^{\sum_{h=1}^n x_{ih}x_{hj} }  \Big\}
      \,   \ ,
         \label{GWESP2}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where the convention is used that $x_{jj} = 0$ for all $j$.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{gwespCurves.png}
\end{center}
\caption{ GWESP weight for a tie closing $s$ two-paths for
                    $\alpha = \infty, 1.2, 0.69, 0$.}
\label{F_gwesp2}
\end{figure}

The parameter $\alpha$ is a tuning parameter that may range from 0 to $\infty$.
The internal effect parameter is defined as $100 \times \alpha$.
For all $\alpha$, it holds that
$ \text{GWESP}(0, \alpha) = 0,\  \text{GWESP}(1, \alpha) = 1,$
and $\text{GWESP}(k, \alpha) $ increases with $k$ to a maximum
slightly less than $e^\alpha$.
For $\alpha = 0$ the coefficients
$e^{\alpha} \,\big\{1 \,-\, \big(1 - e^{-\alpha}\big)^k\big\} $
are equal to 1 for all $k \geq 1$,
and for $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$ they tend to $k$.
Since we can write
\[
  \sum_{j,h} x_{ih}x_{hj}x_{ij} \,=\, \sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k\, \text{EP}_{ik}   \ ,
\]
this implies that for $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$  the regular number
of transitive triplets is approached, while for smaller $\alpha$
the extra contribution of a high number of intermediaries $h$
is downweighted.
An often used value is $\alpha = \log(2) = 0.69$ \citep{SPRH06},
corresponding to an internal effect parameter of 69,
\begin{verbatim}
myeffects <- setEffect(myeffects, gwespFF, parameter=69)
\end{verbatim}
but it is worthwhile to try out different values of $\alpha$
to see which one gives the best fit.

Although the fit statistic of the GWESP effect is identical to that
for transitive ties for $\alpha=0$ and approximates the fit
statistic for transitive triplets
for large $\alpha$, the estimates are not the same because some other
calculations are done differently. The issue is that the GWESP effects are
not implemented as an evaluation effect, but as an elementary effect,
where for the change statistic only changes of the tie $i \rightarrow j$ in
(\ref{GWESP2}) are considered, and not of the tie $i \rightarrow h$.

Thus, the GWESP effects are defined in \RS as the elementary effects
\begin{equation}
 s^{\rm el}_{i\vit}(x) \,=\,
       x_{ij} \,
                        e^{\alpha} \,\Big\{1 \,-\, \big(1 -
                        e^{-\alpha}\big)^{\sum_{h=1}^n x_{ih}x_{hj} }  \Big\}
      \,   \ .
         \label{GWESP3}
\end{equation}

It should be noted that although the GWESP statistic is not triadic but
depends on higher-order configurations, still it is actor-oriented
in the sense that only those configurations are considered that are part of the
personal network, i.e., the set of actors immediately connected
to the focal actor $i$.

The other types of GWESP effect are analogous, with
different tie orientations. They are defined as follows:\\
\texttt{gwespBB}: uses $\text{EPBB}_{ik}$, counting the number of nodes $j$
with $i \rightarrow j$ and there are exactly $k$ other
nodes $h$ for which there is the two-path $i \leftarrow h \leftarrow j$;\\
\texttt{gwespFB}: uses $\text{EPFB}_{ik}$, counting the number of nodes $j$
with $i \rightarrow j$ and there are exactly $k$ other
nodes $h$ for which there is the two-out-star $i \rightarrow h \leftarrow j$;\\
\texttt{gwespBF}: uses $\text{EPBF}_{ik}$, counting the number of nodes $j$
with $i \rightarrow j$ and there are exactly $k$ other
nodes $h$ for which there is the two-in-star $i \leftarrow h \rightarrow j$;\\
(the last two were incorrect in the manual before 23/06/2017)\\
\texttt{gwespRR}: uses $\text{EPRR}_{ik}$, counting the number of nodes $j$
with $i \rightarrow j$ and there are exactly $k$ other
nodes $h$ for which there are the reciprocal ties $i \rightleftarrows h \rightleftarrows j$.

In version 1-1.251 the implementation was changed (thanks to Nynke Niezink),
because earlier versions were not quite according to what is described above.
The effect was until version 1-1.250 implemented as\\
$c_1 + c_2 \times \text{GWESPFF}(i, \alpha')$\\
for values $c_1(\alpha)$ and $c_2(\alpha)$ not dependent on $x$, and with
positive parameters $\alpha$, $\alpha'$ related according to
$\exp(-\alpha) + \exp(-\alpha') = 1$. Note that for the default value
$\alpha = \log(2)$ corresponding to the effect parameter 69 (see above), $\alpha = \alpha'$.

\item two variations of the
   \emph{GWDSP (geometrically weighted dyadwise shared partners)} effects:
   \texttt{gwdspFF} and \texttt{gwdspFB}.
   These are defined, respectively, by
\begin{equation}
  \text{GWDSPFF}(i, \alpha) \,=\,
       \sum_{h=1;\; h \neq i}^n \, e^{\alpha} \,\Big\{1 \,-\, \big(1 -
   e^{-\alpha}\big)^{\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}x_{jh} }  \Big\}    \,   \ ,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \text{GWDSPFB}(i, \alpha) \,=\,
       \sum_{h=1;\; h \neq i}^n \, e^{\alpha} \,\Big\{1 \,-\, \big(1 -
   e^{-\alpha}\big)^{\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}x_{hj} }  \Big\}    \,   \ .
\end{equation}
   It may be noted these are of a quite different nature than most other effects,
   with the outgoing tie variables from $i$ tucked far away in the formula.
   These effects are somewhat similar with respect to what they mean for the
   networks as \texttt{outPop} and \texttt{inPop}, respectively.\\
   Like the gwesp effects, these are similar to the effects developed for
   exponential random graph models (`ERGMs')
   by \citet{SPRH06}, in the parametrisation of \citet{Hunter2007}.
   They are motivated because they are natural companions to \texttt{gwespFF}
   and \texttt{gwespFB}, as the conditions for the transitive closure
   expressed by the latter two effects.\\
   These effects are implemented as regular effects, not as elementary effects.

 \item {\em number of (unilateral) peripheral relations to dense triads},\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_{j,h,k} x_{ij} (1-x_{ji})(1-x_{hi})(1-x_{ki})
 I\{ (x_{jh}\,  + x_{hj}\, + x_{jk}\, + x_{kj}\, + x_{hk}\, + x_{kh}\,)\geq p \} \,$,\\
 where $p$ is the same constant as in the {\it dense triads} effect;\\
 for symmetric networks, the `unilateral' condition is dropped, and the definition is\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_{j,h,k} x_{ij} (1-x_{hi})(1-x_{ki})
 I\{ (x_{jh}\,  + x_{hj}\, + x_{jk}\, + x_{kj}\, + x_{hk}\, + x_{kh}\,)\geq p \} \,$;



 \item {\em in-degree related popularity effect} \texttt{(inPop)}
 (earlier called {\em popularity} or {\em popularity of alter effect}), defined by
  the sum of
 the in-degrees of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{+j} =
 \sum_j x_{ij} \sum_h x_{hj} = \sum_j x_{ij} (\sum_{h \neq i} x_{hj} + 1)$;\\
 in \RS 3 until version 3.313, this effect was multiplied by a factor $1/n$;\\
 in \RS this effect has had a bug until version 1.1-219;\\
 in \RS the target statistic for this effect was multiplied by a factor $n$ until version 1.1-241;

 \item {\em in-degree related popularity effect (centered)} \texttt{(inPop.c)},
 defined by the sum of
 the centered in-degrees of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \big( x_{+j} - d \big)$,\\
 where $d$ is the average in-degree across all waves;

 \item {\em in-degree related popularity (sqrt) effect} \texttt{(inPopSqrt)}
 (earlier called {\em popularity of alter (sqrt measure) effect}), defined by the sum of
 the square roots of the in-degrees of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sqrt{x_{+j}} =
  \sum_j x_{ij} \sqrt{\sum_h x_{hj}} $;\\
 this often works better in practice than the raw popularity effect;
 also it is often reasonable to assume that differences between high in-degrees are
 relatively less important than the same differences between low
 in-degrees;


 \item {\em in-degree related popularity dyadic effect} \texttt{(inPop\_dya)},
 	 defined as the elementary effect version of the half-centered
 squared in-degree of the other to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $ f^{\rm net,\, el}_{i\vit}(x)  =  \big(  x_{+j} - \bar x_{+.}\big)$ ,\\
 where\\
 $ \bar x_{+.} \,=\,  \frac{1}{MK} \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{i,j} x_{ij} \ ,  $ \\
 with $K$ the number of $j$ (for one-mode networks this is $n$,
 for two-mode networks this is the number of nodes in the second mode);\\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $f^{\rm net,\, el}_{i\vit}(x)  =   \sqrt{  x_{+j}}  - \sqrt{ \bar x_{+.}} $ \ ; \\
 since this is an elementary effect, it can be used in interactions
 and in endowment and creation functions;

 \item {\em out-degree related popularity effect} \texttt{(outPop)}
 (earlier called {\em activity} or {\em activity of alter effect}), defined by
  the sum of the out-degrees
 of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{j+} =
  \sum_j x_{ij} \sum_h x_{jh} $; \\
 until version 3.313, this effect was multiplied by a factor $1/n$;

 \item {\em out-degree related popularity effect (centered)} \texttt{(outPop.c)},
 defined by the sum of
 the centered out-degrees of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \big( x_{j+} - d \big)$,\\
 where $d$ is the average out-degree across all waves;

 \item {\em out-degree related popularity (sqrt) effect} \texttt{(outPopSqrt)}
 (earlier called {\em activity of alter (sqrt measure) effect}), defined by the sum of
 the square roots of the out-degrees of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sqrt{x_{j+}} =
  \sum_j x_{ij} \sqrt{\sum_h x_{jh}} $;\\
 this often works better in practice than the raw activity effect
 for the same reasons as mentioned above for the sqrt measure of the popularity effect;

 \item {\em reciprocal degree-related popularity effect} \texttt{(reciPop)}
 defined by the sum of the reciprocal degrees
 of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, x^{(r)}_{j} $, \\
 where the reciprocal degree is defined by\\
 $ x^{(r)}_{j} = \sum_h x_{jh}x_{hj} $.

 \item {\em reciprocal degree-related popularity (sqrt) effect } \texttt{(reciPopSqrt)}
 defined by the sum of the square roots of the reciprocal degrees
 of the others to whom $i$ is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sqrt{x^{(r)}_{j}} $, \\
 where the reciprocal degree is defined as above;

 \item[{\hspace*{-1ex}$\bigodot$}] for non-directed networks, the popularity and activity
 effects are taken together as `degree effects',
 since in-degrees and out-degrees are the same in this case;

 \item {\em in-degree related activity effect}, \texttt{(inAct)}
 defined as  the cross-product  of the actor's in- and out-degrees,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = x_{i+}\, x_{+i}$;\\
 endowment effect only likelihood-based;

 \item {\em in-degree related activity ego effect} \texttt{(inAct\_ego)},
 	 defined as the elementary effect version of the  half-centered  cross-product
 of the actor's in- and out-degrees,\\
 $ f^{\rm net,\, el}_{i\vit}(x) = \big(  x_{+i} - \bar x_{+.}\big)$\ ,\\
 where\\
 $ \bar x_{+.} \,=\,  \frac{1}{Mn} \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{i,j} x_{ij} \ $ ;
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $f^{\rm net,\, el}_{i\vit}(x)  =   \sqrt{   x_{+i}} - \sqrt{\bar x_{+.}} $ \ ; \\
 since this is an elementary effect, it can be used in interactions
 and in endowment and creation functions;

 defined by the sum of
 the cross-product of the actor's out- and centered in-degrees,\\

 \item {\em in-degree related activity (sqrt) effect}, \texttt{(inActSqrt)}
 defined by  \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = x_{i+}\,\sqrt{x_{+i}}$ ;

\item \emph{in-isolate Outdegree effect}, (\texttt{inIsDegree}), the
      (additional) out-degree (or activity)
      effect for actors with in-degree zero, defined as the out-degree
      but only if the actor has in-degree zero,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x, z) =   I\{x_{+i} = 0 \}\, \sum_j x_{ij}   $ ;\\

 \item {\em out-degree related activity effect} \texttt{(outAct)},

 \item {\em out-degree related activity ego effect} \texttt{(outAct\_ego)},
 	 defined as the elementary effect version of the half-centered
 squared out-degree of the actor,\\

 where\\
 $ \bar x_{.+} \,=\,  \frac{1}{Mn} \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{i,j} x_{ij} \ ;  $ \\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $f^{\rm net,\, el}_{i\vit}(x)  =   \sqrt{  x_{i+}} -  \sqrt{\bar x_{.+}} $ \ ; \\
 since this is an elementary effect, it can be used in interactions
 and in endowment and creation functions;

 \item {\em out-degree related activity effect (centered)} \texttt{(outAct.c)},
 defined by the out-degree times the centered out-degree of the actor,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  x_{i+}\,\big( x_{i+} - d \big)$,\\
 where $d$ is the average out-degree across all waves;

 \item {\em out-degree related activity (sqrt) effect}  \texttt{(outActSqrt)}
 (earlier called {\em out-degree$\,\hat{\ }$(1.5)}), defined by  \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = x^{1.5}_{i+} = x_{i+}\,\sqrt{x_{i+}}$ \\
 endowment effect only likelihood-based;

 \item {\em reciprocal degree-related activity effect} \texttt{(reciAct)}
 defined by the degree of $i$ multiplied by $i$'s reciprocal degree,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =   x_{i+}\, x^{(r)}_{i} $; \\
 where the reciprocal degree is defined as above;\\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =   x_{i+}\, \sqrt{x^{(r)}_{i}} $ \ ; \\

 \item {\em reciprocal degree related activity ego effect} \texttt{(reciAct\_ego)},
 	 defined as the elementary effect version of the
 degree of $i$ multiplied by $i$'s centered reciprocal degree,\\
 $ f^{\rm net,\, el}_{i\vit}(x)  =  \big( x^{(r)}_{i} - \bar x^{(r)} \big) $, \\
 where \\
 $ \bar x^{(r)}  \,=\, \frac{1}{Mn} \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{i,j} x_{ij}\,x_{ji} \ ;  $ \\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $f^{\rm net,\, el}_{i\vit}(x)  =   \sqrt{ x^{(r)}_{i}} - \sqrt{\bar x^{(r)}} $ \ ; \\
 since this is an elementary effect, it can be used in interactions
 and in endowment and creation functions;

 \item {\em out-degree up to $p$} (\emph{truncated out-degree}) \texttt{(outTrunc)},
 where $p$ is some constant
 (internal effect parameter, see above),  there are two implementations here:
 \texttt{outTrunc} and \texttt{outTrunc2}, to allow the simultaneous use of this
 effect with 2 different internal effect parameters; the effect is
 defined by  \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \text{min}(x_{i+}\,,\, p)$;\\
 note that for $p=1$ this represents --inversely-- the tendency to be an isolate
 with respect to outgoing ties, i.e., have out-degree equal to 0:
 $ \text{min}(x_{i+}\,,\, 1) = 0$ if $x_{i+} = 0$, and
 $ \text{min}(x_{i+}\,,\, 1) = 1$ if $x_{i+} \geq 1$.\\
 Since the representation is inverse, a result like a negative coefficient
 $ -1.2$ for \texttt{outTrunc} (internal effect parameter $p=1$) is interpreted
 as a positive tendency $+1.2$ toward outdegrees equal to 0; the standard
 error is unchanged. In the case of $p=1$, an alternative and more directly
 comprehensible name is \emph{outdegree at least 1} effect.\\
 Note that the \texttt{outIso} effect (see below) is equivalent
 to \texttt{outTrunc} for $p=1$, but with the opposite sign.

 Compare what is written below about the in-isolate effects:
     the isolation effects are difficult to interpret in words or pictures,
     because they are not based on subgraph counts.
 This holds for the \texttt{outTrunc}($p=1$) effect but, in modified form,
 also for the \texttt{outTrunc} effect generally,
 The interpretation can best be understood from the change statistics.
 The \texttt{outTrunc} effect has a change statistic of +1 when actor $i$
 creates a link, if the previous outdegree of $i$ is less than $p$.
 For $p=1$, this means a change statistic of +1 for the creation of the
 first outgoing tie of $i$, and of --1 for the termination of the last outgoing tie.

 \item {\em out-isolate} (\texttt{outIso}), defined by \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = I\{x_{i+} \,=\,  0\}$;\\
 this is equivalent to \texttt{outTrunc} for $p=1$,
 but with a sign reversal for the parameter;


 \item {\em out-degree more than $p$} where $p$ is some constant
 (internal effect parameter, see above),
  there are two implementations here:
 \texttt{outMore}, \texttt{outMore2}, and \texttt{outMore3},
 to allow the simultaneous use of this
 effect with three different internal effect parameters;
 they are defined by \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \text{max}(x_{i+}\,-\, p, \, 0)$;\\
 this can be regarded as the mirror image of \texttt{outTrunc};

 \item {\em square root out-degree}, defined by  \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sqrt{x_{i+}}$;\\
 this is left out in later versions of \si;

 \item {\em squared (out-degree -- $p$)}, where $p$ is some constant,
 defined by  \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = (x_{i+} - p)^2$,\\
 where $p$ is chosen to diminish the collinearity between this
 and the density effect;\\
 this is left out in later versions of \si;

 \item {\em sum of (1/(out-degree + $p$)} \texttt{(outInv)},
 where $p$ is some constant,  defined by  \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = 1/(x_{i+} + p)$;\\
 endowment effect only likelihood-based;

 \item {\em sum of (1/(out-degree + $p$)(out-degree + $p+1$))} \texttt{(outSqInv)},
 where $p$ is some constant, defined by  \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = 1/(x_{i+} + p)(x_{i+} + p + 1)$;\\
 endowment effect only likelihood-based.

 to be tied to other actors who likewise have high out-degrees,\\

 $p$ can be 1 or 2 (the latter value is the default);

 \item {\em out-in degree$\,\hat{\ }$(1/p) assortativity}
 \texttt{(outInAss)},

 to be tied to other actors who have high in-degrees,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, {x_{i+}^{1/p}} {x_{+j}^{1/p}} $;\\

\iffalse
The next three effects, `anti isolates', `anti in-isolates',
and `anti in-near-isolates',
are not regular effects in the evaluation function tradition.
They are gratification effects as defined in \citet{Snijders01},
which can be defined as components of the function $u_i(x^0, x)$ in
(\ref{probab}) in Section~\ref{S_mathmod}.
In the operation of \rs, specifying the `endowment' or `creation'
types in the effects object will mean that these effects operate
only for maintaining existing or for creating new ties -- as usual.

For these three effects, the method implemented in \RS for dealing with
missing data will not work well if
(for the anti isolates and anti in-isolates effects),
for some actors $j$ with true indegree 1 or more, missing tie variables
might decrease the observed indegree to 0;
and (in the case of the anti in-near-isolates effect),
for some actors $j$ with true indegree 2 or more, missing tie variables
might decrease the observed indegree to 0 or 1.

\item \emph{anti isolates effect}, (\texttt{antiIso}), the effect of
      wishing to connect to others who otherwise would
      be a total isolate, i.e., have no incoming or outgoing
      ties, and wishing not to sever connections to
      others who thereby would become a total isolate,\\
$s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j I\{x_{+j} \geq 1, x_{j+} = 0\} $;\\

 %      This is defined not by an evaluation statistic but only by a
%      change statistic (contribution to the function (\ref{probab})
%      in Section~\ref{S_mathmod}).
%      The value of the change statistic is +1 when making a
%      new connection to an isolate,
%      and --1 when terminating a connection to an actor who subsequently
%      would be an isolate:\\
%$g^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x^0, x) =  I\{x^0_{+j} = x^0_{j+} = 0,\, x_{ij} = 1 \} -
%                  I\{x^0_{+j}  = 1,\, x^0_{j+} = 0,\, x_{ij} = 0 \} $ .\\
%      The target statistic is the number of
%      actors with outdegrees 0 and indegrees of value at least 1,
%      multiplied by the number of actors.\\
%      Note: perhaps this effect is of limited use, as it would be
%      better to define the target statistic by posing the requirement
%      of an outdegree 0 at the starting rather than the end wave
%      of the period;
%      but this is not straightforward in the architecture of  \rs.\\
%      Note the remark above concerning missing data.

\item \emph{anti in-isolates effect}, (\texttt{antiInIso}), the effect of
      wishing to connect to others who otherwise would have
      no incoming ties, and wishing not to sever connections to
      others who thereby would lose their last incoming connection: \\
$s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j I\{x_{+j} \geq 1 \} $;\\
     the isolation effects are difficult to interpret in words or pictures,
     because they are not based on subgraph counts, and the in-isolation
     effects are especially difficult.
     The interpretation can best be understood from the change statistics.
     The anti in-isolates effect has a change statistic of +1 when actor $i$
     creates a link to some other actor who previously had indegree 0; and
     (by implication) a change statistic of --1 when the actor was the only one to link to some
     other actor and now drops the link;

\item \emph{anti in-near-isolates effect}
 = \emph{indegree at least 2 effect}, (\texttt{antiInIso2 = in2Plus}),
      the effect of
      wishing to make a new connection to others who currently have
      an indegree equal to 1, and wishing not to sever connections to
      others who currently have an indegree equal to 2:\\
$s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j I\{x_{+j} \geq 2 \} $;\\
    the anti in-near-isolates effect has a contribution of +1 when actor $i$
     creates a link to some actor who previously had indegree 1, and
     (by implication) --1 when the actor drops a link to some
     other actor who before this had indegree +2;

\item \emph{indegree at least 3 effect}, (\texttt{in3Plus}),
      the effect of
      wishing to make a new connection to others who currently have
      an indegree equal to 2, and wishing not to sever connections to
      others who currently have an indegree equal to 3:\\
$s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j I\{x_{+j} \geq 3 \} $;

\item \emph{isolate popularity effect}, (\texttt{isolatePop}), the effect of
      being tied to actors who further are isolates
      (the fact that such a tie does exist will give the other actor
      an in-degree of 1),\\
$s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, I\{x_{+j} = 1, x_{j+} = 0 \} $ .\\
     Note that perhaps this effect is of limited use, as other (third) actors
     might increase the indegree of $j$ to more than 1, and then the ex-isolate
     does not contribute any more to $i$'s evaluation of the network;
     the three effects above ( `anti isolates', `anti in-isolates',
     and `anti in-near-isolates') may be more useful instead.
\setcounter{savenumi}{\value{enumi}}
\end{enumerate}

      Note that the network-isolate effect expresses the tendency for ego
      to be an isolate (not sending ties if ego has indegree 0),
      whereas the in-isolate and
      isolate popularity effect express the tendency for ego
      to connect to others who, without this connection, would
      have an indegree of 0, or be total isolates, respectively.
      Thus, in modeling the number of isolates, for the network-isolate
      effect the agency is in the isolate (see the $i$ in the formula),
      whereas for the various anti isolates and the isolate popularity
      effects the agency is in others connecting (or not)
      to the isolate (see the $j$ in the formulae).

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}
\item only in \textsf{RSienaTest}: \emph{Simmelian outdegree effect}, (\texttt{simmelian}), the effect of
      the Simmelian outdegree. The Simmelian transformation of the network is
      the network composed of all ties embedded in at least one complete triad:
\[
    x^{\rm{simm}}_{ij} \,=\, \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
                               1 & x_{ij} = x_{ji} = 1 \text{ and} \\
                                  & \ \text{ there is at least one }
                                      h \text{ for which } x_{hi} = x_{ih} = x_{hj} = x_{jh} = 1 \\
                               0 & \text{else.}
                             \end{array} \right.
\]
      In other words, these ties must be reciprocal, and there must be at least one
      third actor to whom both have a mutual tie.
      The Simmelian outdegree of $i$ is  \\
$s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x ) = \sum_j  x^{\rm{simm}}_{ij} $ .\\

\textbf{\emph{Dyadic covariate effects}}
\medskip

\noindent
The effects for a dyadic covariate $w_{ij}$ are
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}

 \item {\em covariate (centered) main effect} \texttt{(X)},\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \, (w_{ij} - \bar{w}) $\\
 where $\bar{w}$ is the mean value of $w_{ij}\,$;

 \item {\em covariate (centered) $\times$ reciprocity} \texttt{(XRecip)},\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} x_{ji} \, (w_{ij} - \bar{w}) $.

 \item[{\hspace*{-1ex}$\bigodot$}]
Various different ways can be modeled in which
 a triadic combination can be made between
 the dyadic covariate and the network.
 In the explanation, the dyadic covariate
 is regarded as a weighted network
 (which will be reduced to a non-weighted network if $w_{ij}$ only
 assumes the values 0 and 1).
 By way of exception, the dyadic covariate
 is not centered in these effects
 (to make it better interpretable as a network).
 In the text and the pictures, an arrow with the letter $W$
 represents a tie according to the weighted network $W$.

 this refers to the closure of $W-W$ two-paths;
 each $W-W$ two-path
 $i \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} h \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} j$
 is weighted by the product $w_{ih} w_{hj}$
 and the sum of these product weights measures the
 strength of the tendency toward closure of
 these $W-W$ twopaths by a tie.

\textbf{\emph{Monadic covariate effects}}
\medskip

\noindent
For actor-dependent covariates $v_j$ (recall that these are
centered internally by \si, unless they are constructed with
\texttt{centered = FALSE}), as well as for dependent behavior
variables (for notational simplicity here also denoted $v_j$;
these variables also are centered),
the following effects are available:
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}

 \item {\em covariate-alter} or {\em covariate-related popularity}
 \texttt{(altX)},
 defined by the sum of the covariate over all actors to whom $i$ has a tie,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, v_j$;

 \item {\em covariate squared - alter} or {\em squared covariate-related popularity} \texttt{(altSqX)},
 defined by the sum of the squared covariate over all actors to whom $i$ has a tie,
 (not included if the variable has range less than 2)\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, v_j^2$;

 \item {\em right threshold covariate alter}
 \texttt{(altRThresholdX)},
 defined by the number of actors to whom $i$ has a tie
 and whose covariate value
 is greater than (to the right of)  or equal to a threshold $p$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, I\{v_j \geq p\} $;\\
 for an actor covariate this (and the following effect)
 can also be obtained as \texttt{altX} for a transformed
 covariate, but this would be impossible for a behavioral dependent variable $V$;\\
 note that behavioral dependent variables always are centered!

 \item {\em left threshold covariate alter}
 \texttt{(altLThresholdX)},
 defined by the number of actors to whom $i$ has a tie
 and whose covariate value
 is smaller than (to the left of)  or equal to a threshold $p$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, I\{v_j \leq p\} $;\\
 note that behavioral dependent variables always are centered;
 i.e., the overall mean is subtracted!

 \item {\em outdegree to actors with positive covariate more than $p$},
  \texttt{outXMore},
  where $p$ is some constant (internal effect parameter, see above),
defined by \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \text{max}\big( (\sum_j x_{ij}\, I\{v_j > 0\}) \,-\, p,\, 0 \big)$;\\
 this is meant primarily for non-centered dummy variables $v_j$;

 \item {\em covariate-ego} or {\em covariate-related activity}
 \texttt{(egoX)},
 defined by $i$'s out-degree weighted by his covariate value,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = v_i \, x_{i+} $;

 \item {\em covariate squared - ego} or {\em squared covariate-related activity}
 \texttt{(egoSqX)},
 defined by $i$'s out-degree weighted by his covariate value squared,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = v_i^2 \, x_{i+} $;

 \item {\em right threshold covariate ego}
 \texttt{(egoRThresholdX)},
 defined by $i$'s out-degree when $i$'s covariate value
 is greater than (to the right of)  or equal to a threshold $p$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = I\{v_i \geq p\} \, x_{i+} $;\\
 for an actor covariate this (and the following effect)
 can also be obtained by transforming
 the covariate, but this would be impossible for a behavioral dependent
 variable $V$;\\
 note that behavioral dependent variables always are centered!

 \item {\em left threshold covariate ego}
 \texttt{(egoLThresholdX)},
 defined by $i$'s out-degree when $i$'s covariate value
 is less than (to the right of) or equal to a threshold $p$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = I\{v_i \leq p\} \, x_{i+} $;\\
 note that behavioral dependent variables always are centered!

 \item {\em absolute difference outdegree -- covariate}
 \texttt{(degAbsDiffX)},
 defined by the absolute difference between $i$'s out-degree and his covariate value,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \ \mid x_{i+} \,-\, \lfloor v_i \rfloor \mid $;\\
 here $\lfloor v_i \rfloor $ is $v_i$ truncated to the largest integer
 not larger than $v_i$;
 working with a non-centered covariate may be advisable for this effect;

 \item {\em positive difference outdegree -- covariate}
 \texttt{(degPosDiffX)},
 defined by the positive part of the difference between $i$'s out-degree
 and her covariate value,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \max \{ x_{i+} \,-\, \lfloor v_i \rfloor  ,\, 0 \} $;\\
 here $\lfloor v_i \rfloor $ is $v_i$ truncated to the largest integer
 not larger than $v_i$;
 working with a non-centered covariate may be advisable for this effect;

 \item {\em negative difference outdegree -- covariate}
 \texttt{(degNegDiffX)},
 defined by the negative part of the difference between $i$'s out-degree
 and her covariate value,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  - \, \min \{ x_{i+} \,-\, \lfloor v_i \rfloor  ,\, 0 \}
 \,=\, \max \{ \lfloor v_i \rfloor \,-\, x_{i+} ,\, 0 \}  $;\\
 here $\lfloor v_i \rfloor $ is $v_i$ truncated to the largest integer
 not larger than $v_i$;
 working with a non-centered covariate may be advisable for this effect;

 \item \hypertarget{T_simx}{{\em covariate-related similarity}} \texttt{(simX)},
 \label{simx}
 defined by the sum of centered similarity scores ${\rm sim}^v_{ij}$
 between $i$  and the other actors $j$ to whom he is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} ({\rm sim}^v_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}) $,\\
 where $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is the mean of all similarity scores, which are defined as
 ${\rm sim}^v_{ij}=\frac{\Delta-\vert v_i - v_j \vert}{\Delta}$ with
 $\Delta=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ being the observed range of the covariate $v$
 (this mean is given in the output file just before the
 `initial data description'; it is also given, e..g., for data set \texttt{mydata}
 and constant covariate \texttt{mycov}, by
 \texttt{attr(mydata\$cCovars\$mycov, "simMean")});\\
 the definition of ${\rm sim}^v_{ij}$ is discussed in
 section~\ref{S_internal}, see (\ref{simV});

 \item {\em covariate-difference} or {\em covariate-related difference}
 \texttt{(diffX)},
 defined by the alter-minus-ego difference of the covariate over all actors
 to whom $i$ has a tie,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, (v_j - v_i)$;

 \item {\em absolute covariate-difference} or {\em covariate-related absolute difference}
 \texttt{(absDiffX)},
 defined by the absolute value of the alter-ego difference of the covariate over all actors
 to whom $i$ has a tie,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, |\,v_j - v_i\,|$;

 \item {\em covariate-squared-difference} or {\em covariate-related squared difference}
 \texttt{(diffSqX)},
 defined by the squared alter-minus-ego difference of the covariate over all actors
 to whom $i$ has a tie,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, (v_j - v_i)^2$;

 \item {\em covariate-ego $\times$ difference} or {\em covariate-related ego-difference interaction}
 \texttt{(egoDiffX)},
 defined by ego's value times the alter-minus-ego difference of the covariate over all actors
 to whom $i$ has a tie,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, v_i \, (v_j - v_i)$;


 \item {\em covariate-ego $\times$ alter} \texttt{(egoXaltX)},
 defined by the product of $i$'s covariate and the sum of those of his alters,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = v_i \, \sum_j x_{ij}\, v_j $;

 \item {\em covariate-ego $\times$ alter $\times$ reciprocity}
 \texttt{(egoXaltXRecip)},
 defined by the product of $i$'s covariate and the sum of those
 of his reciprocated alters,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = v_i \, \sum_j x_{ij}\,x_{ji}\, v_j $;

 \item {\em covariate-related similarity $\times$ reciprocity}
 \texttt{(simRecipX)}, defined by
 the sum of centered similarity scores for all
 reciprocal dyads in which $i$ is situated,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}x_{ji} ({\rm sim}^v_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}) $;

 \item \emph{same covariate}, which can also be called {\em covariate-related identity}
 \texttt{(sameX)},  defined by the
 number of ties of $i$ to all other actors $j$ who have
 exactly the same value on the covariate,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, I\{v_i = v_j \} $,\\
 where the indicator function $I\{v_i = v_j \} $ is 1 if the condition $\{v_i = v_j \} $
 is satisfied, and 0 if it is not;\\

 \item {\em same covariate $\times$ reciprocity}
\texttt{(sameXRecip)} defined by the
 number of reciprocated ties between $i$ and all other actors $j$ who have
 exactly the same value on the covariate,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} x_{ji}\, I\{v_i = v_j \} $;

 \item \emph{different covariate}  \texttt{(unequalX)},  defined by the
 number of ties of $i$ to all other actors $j$ who have
 a different value on the covariate,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, I\{v_i \neq v_j \} $,\\
 where the indicator function $I\{v_i \neq v_j \} $ is 1 if the condition $\{v_i \neq v_j \} $
 is satisfied, and 0 if it is not;\\
 this is the converse of the  \texttt{sameX} effect,
 and can be useful in interactions;

 \item {\em in-degree popularity weighted by sender's V }
  \texttt{(inPopX)}\\
 defined by the sum of values of $V$ for actors $h$
 for which there are ties  $ i \rightarrow j \leftarrow h$,
 i.e., an in-two-star;
 the value $\sum_h x_{hj}\,v_h$ can be regarded as a $V$-weighted
 version of the indegree of $j$:\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sum_h x_{hj}\,v_h  $ \\
 or for $p=2$ \\
   $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sqrt{\sum_h x_{hj}\,v_h}   $;\\
 note that to use this effect for $p=2$ the variable $V$ must be nonnegative,
 which implies that it must be non-centered;\\
 further note that if $V$ is a behavioral variable, it will be used
 in the centered version, so that $p$ must be 1; if weighting by
 a non-centered behavioral variable is desired, a new effect is necessary;

 \item {\em in-degree activity weighted by sender's V } \texttt{(inActX)}\\
 defined by the sum of values of $V$ for actors $h$
 for which there are ties  $h \rightarrow i \rightarrow j$,
 i.e., a two-path with $i$ in the middle;
 the value $\sum_h x_{hi}\,v_h$ can be regarded as a $V$-weighted
 version of the indegree of $i$:\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sum_h x_{hi}\,v_h  $ \\
 or for $p=2$ \\
   $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sqrt{\sum_h x_{hi}\,v_h}   $;\\
 note that to use this effect for $p=2$ the variable $V$ must be nonnegative,
 which implies that it must be non-centered;


 \item {\em out-degree popularity weighted by receiver's V }  \texttt{(outPopX)}\\
 defined by the sum of values of $V$ for actors $h$
 for which there are ties  $ i \rightarrow j \rightarrow h$,
 i.e., at out-distance 2;
 the value $\sum_h x_{jh}\,v_h$ can be regarded as a $V$-weighted
 version of the outdegree of $j$:\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sum_h x_{jh}\,v_h  $ \\
 or for $p=2$ \\
   $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sqrt{\sum_h x_{jh}\,v_h}   $;\\
 note that to use this effect for $p=2$ the variable $V$ must be nonnegative,
 which implies that it must be non-centered;

 \item {\em out-degree activity weighted by receiver's V }   \texttt{(outActX)}\\
 defined by the sum of values of $V$ for actors $h$
 for which there are ties  $h \leftarrow i \rightarrow j$,
 i.e., an out-two-star;
 the value $\sum_h x_{ih}\,v_h$ can be regarded as a $V$-weighted
 version of the outdegree of $i$:\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sum_h x_{ih}\,v_h  $ \\
 or for $p=2$ \\
   $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \sqrt{\sum_h x_{ih}\,v_h}   $;\\
 note that to use this effect for $p=2$ the variable $V$ must be nonnegative,
 which implies that it must be non-centered.

 \item {\em indegree popularity from same covariate}
\texttt{(sameXInPop)} defined by the
 number of incoming ties received by those to whom $i$ is tied
 and sent by others who have the same covariate value as $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \sum_h x_{hj}\, I\{v_i = v_h \} $;\\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \sqrt{\sum_h x_{hj}\, I\{v_i = v_h \}} $;\\

 \item {\em indegree popularity from different covariate}
\texttt{(diffXInPop)} defined by the
 number of incoming ties received by those to whom $i$ is tied
 and sent by others who have a different covariate value than $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \sum_h x_{hj}\, I\{v_i \neq v_h \} $;\\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \sqrt{\sum_h x_{hj}\, I\{v_i \neq v_h \}} $;\\

 \item {\em outdegree activity to same covariate}
\texttt{(sameXOutAct)} defined by the
 squared number of ties to those
 others who have the same covariate value as $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j \big(x_{ij} \, I\{v_i = v_j \}\big)^2 $;\\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij} \, I\{v_i = v_j \}
            \sqrt{\sum_h x_{ih}\, I\{v_i = v_h \}} $;\\

 \item {\em outdegree activity to different covariate}
\texttt{(diffXOutAct)} defined by the
 squared number of ties to those
 others who have a different covariate value than $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \big(\sum_j x_{ij} \,I\{v_i \neq v_j \}\big)^2 $;\\
 for internal effect parameter $p=2$, it is defined by\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij} \, I\{v_i \neq v_j \}
             \sqrt{\sum_h x_{ih}\, I\{v_i \neq v_h \}} $;\\


 \item {\em outdegree activity to homogeneous covariate}
\texttt{(homXOutAct)} defined by the
 sum of outgoing ties weighted by the number of outgoing
 ties to those with the same covariate value (as alter),\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \sum_h x_{ih} \,I\{v_j = v_h \} $;

 \item {\em outdegree activity weighted by alter's covariate}
  \texttt{(altXOutAct)} defined by the
 squared sum of ties weighted by alter's covariate values,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \big(\sum_j x_{ij} \,v_j \big)^2 $;\\
 since the covariate here is used as a weight, this probably
 makes sense especially for non-centered covariates;


 \item {\em reciprocal degree activity to same covariate}
\texttt{(sameXReciAct)} defined by the outdegree of $i$,
 multiplied by the number of $i$'s reciprocated ties
 to others who have the same covariate value as $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\,
                \sum_h x_{ih}\,x_{hi}\, I\{v_i = v_h \} $;

 \item {\em reciprocal degree activity to different covariate}
\texttt{(diffXReciAct)} defined by the outdegree of $i$,
 multiplied by the number of $i$'s reciprocated ties
 to others who have a different covariate value than $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\,
                \sum_h x_{ih}\,x_{hi}\, I\{v_i \neq v_h \} $;


\item only in \textsf{RSienaTest}:  \emph{Simmelian alter X effect}, (\texttt{simmelianAltX}), the effect of
      Simmelian ties weighted by alter's value of $X$. The Simmelian transformation of the network is
      the network composed of all ties embedded in at least one complete triad:
\[
    x^{\rm{simm}}_{ij} \,=\, \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
                               1 & x_{ij} = x_{ji} = 1 \text{ and} \\
                                  & \ \text{ there is at least one }
                                      h \text{ for which } x_{hi} = x_{ih} = x_{hj} = x_{jh} = 1 \\
                               0 & \text{else.}
                             \end{array} \right.
\]
      In other words, these ties must be reciprocal, and there must be at least one
      third actor to whom both have a mutual tie.
      The Simmelian alter $V$ effect  is  \\
$s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x ) = \sum_j  x^{\rm{simm}}_{ij}\,v_j $ .


 \item {\em covariate $\times$ transitive triplets}
 \texttt{(transTripX)}, defined by the sum of transitive triplets
 $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j \leftarrow i$
 weighted by the covariate value for the intermediate actor $h$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
 \sum_j v_h \, x_{ij}\, x_{ih} \, x_{hj} $;\\
 this is meaningful especially if covariate $V$ is non-centered;
 else some weights would be negative, and the term `weight'
 would not be appropriate.
 Note that weighting by the covariate values for $i$ and/or $j$
 can be obtained by `user-defined' interactions of \texttt{transTrip}
 with \texttt{egoX} and/or \texttt{altX}.


 \item {\em same covariate $\times$ transitive triplets}
 \texttt{(sameXTransTrip)}, defined by the number of transitive triplets
 $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j \leftarrow i$
 that have the same covariate value for $i$ and $j$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
 \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{ih} \, x_{hj} \, I\{v_i = v_j\}$;

 \item {\em different covariate $\times$ transitive triplets}
 \texttt{(diffXTransTrip)}, defined by the number of transitive triplets
 $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j \leftarrow i$
 that have different covariate values for $i$ and $j$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
 \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{ih} \, x_{hj} \, I\{v_i \neq v_j\}$;


 \item {\em covariate-related similarity $\times$ transitive triplets}
 \texttt{(simXTransTrip)}, defined by the sum of transitive triplets
 $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j \leftarrow i$
 weighted by the centered similarity scores between $i$ and $j$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{ih} \, x_{hj}
         ({\rm sim}^v_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}) $;

 \item {\em homogeneous covariate $\times$ transitive triplets}
 \texttt{(homXTransTrip)}, defined by the number of transitive triplets
 $i \rightarrow h \rightarrow j \leftarrow i$
 that have the same covariate value for $i$, $j$, and $h$,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
 \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{ih} \, x_{hj} \, I\{v_i = v_j = v_h\}$;

\item
\begin{minipage}[t]{.7\textwidth}
 {\em transitive triplets jumping to different V}
  \texttt{(jumpXTransTrip)}, \\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_{j \neq h} x_{ij}\,
            x_{ih}\, x_{hj}\,I\{v_i = v_h \neq v_j\}$;\\
 this refers to transitive closure, restricted to `jump outside
 of $V$-groups' in the sense that the focal actor and the mediating
 actor have the same value of $V$, but the target actor has a
 different value;

 average of the covariate for this period,  \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =  \sum_j x_{ij} \, \overline {v}  $;\\
 here $\overline {v}$ is the mean of the values $v_{ih}$ for all actors $h$
 in the actor set: for changing covariates, the mean of the wave at the
 start of the period; for behavioral dependent variables,
 the current mean.
 This effect is not meaningful for constant covariates in single-group data.
 It is useful especially for multi-group data sets, where the average value
 varies between groups, and where there are no constant covariates
 in the multi-group object.
 Note that always, the average $\overline {v} $ is centered by the global mean.
 For multi-group data, global centering means centering over all groups.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The following group of effects uses an auxiliary variable $\breve v_j$ which
can be called `alters' $v$-average'.
It is described as the average value of $v_h$ for those $h$
to whom $j$ is tied, and defined mathematically by
\begin{equation}
  \breve v_j = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_h x_{jh}v_h}{x_{j+}}  &  \text{ if } x_{j+} > 0     \\
         \bar v                                &  \text{ if } x_{j+} = 0  ,
  \end{array}   \right.            \label{alt_av}
\end{equation}
where $\bar v$ is the overall observed mean of $V$ (for changing
actor covariates and behavioral variables, the mean over all waves).\\
(It may be noted that, for centered $V$, this constructed variable $\breve v_j$
will not itself have exactly a zero mean generally.)

Note that this value is being updated during the simulations.
Network changes will change $\breve v_j$; if $v_j$ is a dependent behavior
variable, then behaviour changes will also change $\breve v_j$.

In the following list, there is no ego effect, because the ego effect
of $\breve v_j$ would be the same as the alter effect of $v_j$.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}

\item \emph{covariate - alter at distance 2} \texttt{(altDist2)}.
      This effect is associated with an effect parameter
      which can have values 1 or 2.
      For parameter 1, it is
      defined as the sum of alters' covariate-average over all actors
      to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \breve v_j \hfill
            (\text{parameter 1}) \hfill
\]
      For parameter 2, it is defined similarly,
      but for an alters' covariate-average excluding
      ego:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \breve v_j^{(-i)} \hfill
                          (\text{parameter 2}) \hfill
\]
      where
\begin{equation}
  \breve v_j^{(-i)} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_{h \neq i} x_{jh}v_h}{x_{j+} - x_{ji}}  &
                                       \text{ if } x_{j+} - x_{ji} > 0     \\
         \bar v                               &  \text{ if } x_{j+}- x_{ji} = 0  .
  \end{array}   \right.            \label{alt_av2}
\end{equation}
      To compute the contribution for this effect, note that
\[
 \sum_j x_{ij} \breve v_j^{(-i)} = \sum_j x_{ij} \,
                      \frac{x_{j+} \breve v_j - x_{ji}v_i}{x_{j+}-x_{ji}}
\]
      This shows that, given that $\breve v_j$ is being updated for all $j$,
      the contribution for this effect for parameter 2 can be computed as
      \[
       \frac{x_{j+} \breve v_j - x_{ji}v_i}{x_{j+}-x_{ji}}
      \]
      (where 0/0 is interpreted as 0).


\item \emph{total covariate - alter at distance 2} \texttt{(totDist2)}.
      This is like the previous effect, but using the total
      instead of the average value of alter's covariate.
      For parameter 1, it is  defined as
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \, x_{j+}\breve v_j \hfill
            (\text{parameter 1}) \hfill
\]
      and for parameter 2, as
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} (x_{j+} - x_{ji}) \breve v_j^{(-i)} \hfill
                          (\text{parameter 2}) \hfill
\]
      where $\breve v_j$ and $\breve v_j^{(-i)}$ are as above.

\item \emph{ego-(alter-distance-2) covariate - similarity} \texttt{(simEgoDist2)},
      defined as the sum of centered similarity  between $i$
      and alters' covariate-average, for all actors
      $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \Big({\rm sim}(\grave v)_{ij}
  - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}\Big) \ ,
\]
 where the similarity scores ${\rm sim}(\grave v)_{ij}$ are defined as
\[
{\rm sim}(\grave v)_{ij}=
 \frac{\Delta-\vert  v_i - \breve v_j^{(-i)} \vert}{\Delta} \ ,
\]
  where
 $\Delta=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ is the observed range of the
 \emph{original} covariate $v$,
 $\breve v_j^{(-i)}$ is as above in effect \texttt{(altDist2)}
 and $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is the mean of all similarity scores as used also
 for the \texttt{simX} effect; this centering is applied since version 1.1-285.
 For a constant covariate \texttt{mycov}, this mean is given by
 \texttt{attr(mydata\$cCovars\$mycov, "simMean")}.

\item \emph{covariate - similarity at distance 2} \texttt{(simDist2)} ,
      defined as the sum of centered similarity
      values for alters' covariate-average between $i$ and all actors
      $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \,\Big({\rm sim}(\breve v)_{ij}
  - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}\Big) \ ,
\]
 where the similarity scores ${\rm sim}(\breve v)_{ij}$ are defined as
\[
{\rm sim}(\breve v)_{ij}=
 \frac{\Delta-\vert \breve v_i - \breve v_j \vert}{\Delta} \ ,
\]
 while
 $\Delta=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ is the observed range of the
 \emph{original} covariate $v$
 and $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is the mean of all similarity scores as used also
 for the \texttt{simX} effect; this centering is applied since version 1.1-285.
 For a constant covariate \texttt{mycov}, this mean is given by
 \texttt{attr(mydata\$cCovars\$mycov, "simMean")}.\\
\iffalse  until version 1.1-283:
 , and\\
 $\widehat{{\rm sim}(\breve v)}$ is the
 \emph{observed} mean of all these similarity scores;
 this observed mean is defined by calculating the $\breve v_i$ values
 for each of the observations $t_1$ to $t_{M-1}$, and averaging
 these
 $(M-1)n(n-1)$ (or $(M-1)n(n-1)/2$) similarity values.
% checking revealed that no centering is applied.
\fi
  Note that for both ego ($i$) and alter ($j$) their alters' covariate-average
  is used, so that this effect is about a comparison between the
  out-neighbourhoods of $i$ and $j$.


\item \emph{ego-(alter-distance-2) same covariate} \texttt{(sameEgoDist2)},
      defined as the sum, for all actors $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
      of the proportion of values $v_h$ equal to $v_i$
      in their out-neighbourhoods (i.e., for all actors $h$, other than $i$,
      with ties from $j$; configurations $i \rightarrow j \rightarrow h$):
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_{j;\, j \neq i, \, x_{j+} > x_{ij} } \frac{x_{ij}}{x_{j+} - x_{ij}}
                        \, \sum_{h \neq i} x_{jh}\, I\{v_h = v_i\} \ ,
\]
where 0/0 is defined as 0; for internal effect parameter $p=0$ it is defined
as the number of out-ties $j$ who have any outgoing tie to an actor $h$
with $v_h = v_i\,$:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\,
                I\Big\{ \Big( \sum_{h \neq i} x_{jh}\, I\{v_h = v_i\}\Big) > 0 \Big\} \ .
\]

\item \emph{covariate - in - alter at distance 2} \texttt{(altInDist2)}.
     This is defined as the sum of alters' values for
     the average of the covariate values of all their
     incoming ties, except for the possibly incoming tie from ego:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \check v_j^{(-i)}
\]
      where
\begin{equation}
  \check v_j^{(-i)} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_{h \neq i} x_{hj}\,v_h}{x_{+j} - x_{ij}}  &
                                       \text{ if } x_{+j} - x_{ij} > 0     \\
         \bar v                                &  \text{ if } x_{+j}- x_{ij} = 0  ,
  \end{array}   \right.            \label{alt_inav2}
\end{equation}
where $\bar v$ is (again) the global mean of $V$.


\item \emph{total covariate - in - alter at distance 2} \texttt{(totInDist2)}.
     This is defined as the sum of alters' values for
     the total of the covariate values of all their incoming ties,
     except for the possibly incoming tie from ego:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} (x_{+j} - x_{ij}) \check v_j^{(-i)}
                        \,=\ \sum_j x_{ij} \sum_{h \neq i} x_{hj}\,v_h  \ .
\]
    For a non-centered binary variable $V$ with values $v_j$ = 0 or~1,
    this is a $V$-restricted version of indegree popularity.

\item \emph{ego-(in-alter-distance-2) covariate - similarity} \texttt{(simEgoInDist2)},
      defined as the sum of centered similarity  between $i$
      and alters' covariate-in-average, for all actors
      $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \Big({\rm sim}(\acute v)_{ij}
  - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v} \Big) \ ,
\]
 where the similarity scores ${\rm sim}(\acute v)_{ij}$ are defined as
\[
{\rm sim}(\acute v)_{ij}=
 \frac{\Delta-\vert  v_i - \check v_j^{(-i)} \vert}{\Delta} \ ,
\]
 while
 $ \check v_j^{(-i)}$ is as in the definition of \texttt{altInDist2},
 $\Delta=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ is the observed range of the
 \emph{original} covariate $v$, and $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is as above
 (see \texttt{simDist2}).\\
  Note that for ego ($i$) the own value is used and for alter ($j$) the alters' covariate-average
  (these are alter's in-alters!), so that this effect is about a comparison between $i$
   and the in-neighbourhoods of the $j$'s.

\item \emph{ego-(in-alter-distance-2) same covariate} \texttt{(sameEgoInDist2)},
      defined as the sum, for all actors $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
      of the proportion of values $v_h$ equal to $v_i$
      in their in-neighbourhoods (i.e., for all actors $h$, other than $i$,
       who send ties to $j$; configurations $i \rightarrow j \leftarrow h$):
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_{j;\, j \neq i, \, x_{+j} > x_{ij} } \frac{x_{ij}}{x_{+j} - x_{ij}}
                        \, \sum_{h \neq i} x_{hj}\, I\{v_h = v_i\} \ ,
\]
where 0/0 is defined as 0; for internal effect parameter $p=0$ it is defined
as the number of out-ties $j$ who have any incoming tie from an actor $h$
with $v_h = v_i\,$:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\,
                I\Big\{  \Big( \sum_{h \neq i} x_{hj}\, I\{v_h = v_i\} \Big) > 0 \Big\} \ .
\]

\item \emph{ego-(in-alter-distance-2) same covariate} \texttt{(sameEgoInDist2)},
      defined as the sum, for all actors $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,

      in their in-neighbourhoods (i.e., for all actors $h$, other than $i$,

\iffalse
If there are multiple networks, their roles can be crossed here --
the alters' covariate average is calculated
in turn, respectively, for each dependent network variable;
and this is then used as an effect respectively for each of the
dependent network variables -- giving a total of $2 R_N^2$ effects
if $R_N$ is the number of dependent network variables. At this moment
I do not care for all this generality, but I guess the request
could come up at a later stage, so perhaps it is efficient to include
the generality already now.

\iffalse
 \item {\em user-defined interaction effects}
 as described in Section~\ref{S_int_eff}. The internal effect parameter
 is decomposed by \RS into its two or three constituents, see
 in the mentioned section. The interaction is defined on a tie basis:
 if two interacting effects are defined by
 $s^{\rm net}_{ia}(x) = \sum_j s^a_{ij}(x)$ and
 $s^{\rm net}_{ib}(x) = \sum_j s^b_{ij}(x)$
 (where $a$ and $b$ are calculated from the internal effect parameter $p$),
 then the interaction is defined by\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j s^a_{ij}(x) s^b_{ij}(x)$ .

\subsubsection{Special effects for non-directed networks}
\label{S_NonDirEff}

For non-directed (symmetric) networks
\citep[see Section~\ref{S_modeltype_nd} and][]{SnijdersPickup16},
in principle the same effects are used as above; you may search
in this manual for `non-directed' to see the cases where the definition of
an effect for non-directed networks deviates from the
definition for directed networks.
Here we present a few effects that are defined specifically for
non-directed networks. The reason is that non-directed data will not allow
to differentiate between senders and receivers of ties, and instead
of working hypothetically with either ego or alter effects,
it may be preferable to utilize effects where ego and alter are
assumed to have equal contributions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{degree activity plus popularity effect} \texttt{(degPlus)}.
     This is defined as the sum of the in=outdegree popularity
     and in=outdegree activity effects; equivalently, this effect
     operates as the degree popularity combined with the degree activity effect
     under the assumption that the parameters for both are the same:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} (x_{j+} + x_{i+}) \ .
\]
    For internal effect parameter equal to 2, the square roots are taken:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} (\sqrt{x_{j+}} + \sqrt{x_{i+}}) \ .
\]
\item A centered version of \texttt{degPlus}:\\
      \emph{degree activity plus popularity effect (centered)} \texttt{(degPlus.c)};
     This is defined as the sum of the centered in=outdegree popularity
     and in=outdegree activity effects:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} (x_{j+} + x_{i+} - 2 d) \ ,
\]
   where $d$ is the average degree across all waves.
\item \emph{covariate effect} \texttt{(egoPlusAltX)}.
     This is defined as the sum of the covariate-ego and
     covariate-alter effects; equivalently, this effect
     operates as the covariate-ego combined with the covariate-alter effect
     under the assumption that the parameters for both are the same:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} (v_i + v_j) \ .
\]
\item \emph{covariate-squared effect} \texttt{(egoPlusAltSqX)}.
     This is defined as the sum of the covariate-squared ego and
     covariate-squared alter effects; equivalently, this effect
     operates as the covariate-squared ego combined with the
     covariate-squared alter effect
     under the assumption that the parameters for both are the same:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} (v_i^2 + v_j^2) \ ;
\]
  \item {\em transitive triads effect} \texttt{(transTriads)},
   defined by the number of transitive patterns in $i$'s relations,
   which for non-directed networks can be written as\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_{j < h} x_{ij}\, x_{ih}\, x_{hj}\,$;\\
\end{enumerate}
For non-directed networks there is only one degree assortativity effect,
the degree assortativity effect which is the outdegree-indegree
version\footnote{Of the four versions this has the correct change statistic,
because the change in $x_{ij}$ is associated with a change
in both the outdegree of $i$ and the indegree of $j$.}
still with short name \texttt{outInAss}.
There is also only one GWESP effect, called simply \texttt{gwesp}.

\subsubsection{Multiple network effects}
\label{S_MultiNet}

An introduction to the analysis of multiple (multivariate) networks,
with a discussion of the basic effects, is given in \citet{SLT2013}.

See Section~\ref{S_constraints} for the possibility that two networks
have a deterministic constraint by being mutually exclusive,
or by one being implied by the other, or (rarely used, if ever)
by the union of them being the complete graph.

If there are multiple dependent networks, the definition of
cross-network effects is such that always, one network has the
role of the dependent variable, while the other network, or
networks, have the role of explanatory variable(s).
In the following list the network in the role of dependent variable
is denoted by the tie variables $x_{ij}$, while the
tie variables $w_{ij}$ denote the network that is the
explanatory variable.

Various of these effects are applicable only if the networks $X$
and $W$ satisfy certain conditions of conformability; for example,
the first effect of $W$ on $X$ is meaningful only if $W$ and $X$
have the same dimensions, i.e., either both are one-mode networks,
or both are two-mode networks with the same actor set for the second mode;
as another example, the second effect, of incoming $W$ on $X$,
is applicable only if $W$ and $X$ are one-mode networks.
These conditions are hopefully clear from logical considerations,
and drawing a little diagram of the involved nodes and arrows
will be helpful in cases of doubt.

In the \RS output for groups with multiple networks,
the dependent network in each given effect is indicated by
the first part of the effect name.
In the list below, a more or less normally formulated name is given first,
then the name used in \RS between parentheses,
using $X$ as the name for the dependent network and $W$
as the name for the explanatory network,
then between parentheses in \texttt{typewriter font} the \texttt{shortName}
as used by \rs.
Since this is a co-evolution model, \RS will include also the effects
where the roles of $X$ and $W$ are reversed.

The first three effects are dyadic. The first can be regarded
as a main effect; the reciprocity and mutuality effects
will require rather big data sets to be empirically distinguished
from each other.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item {\em Effect of W on X} ($X$: $W$)  \texttt{(crprod)},\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \, w_{ij}  $ ;\\
 $i \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} j$ leads to  $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$;
 this is also called the dyadic entrainment effect;\\
 if one of the contraints of Section~\ref{S_constraints} is in use,
 this effect should not be included because its role is taken over by the
 constraint;

 \item {\em Effect of incoming W on X} ($X$: reciprocity with $W$)  \texttt{(crprodRecip)},\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \, w_{ji}  $ ;\\
 this can be regarded as generalized exchange:
 $j \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} i$ leads to  $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$;

 \item {\em Effect of mutual ties in W on X} ($X$: mutuality with $W$)  \texttt{(crprodMutual)},\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \, w_{ij} \, w_{ji}  $ ;\\
 $j \stackrel{W}{\leftrightarrow} i$ leads to  $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$.

\end{enumerate}

The following are degree-related effects, where nodal degrees
in the $W$ network have effects on popularity or activity in the
$X$  network. They use an internal effect parameter $p$, which
mostly will be 1 or 2.

To decrease correlation with other effects, the
$W$-degrees are centered by subtracting the value $\bar w$,
which is the average degree of $W$ across all observations.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}
 \item {\em Effect of in-degree in W on X-popularity } ($X$: indegree$^{1/p}$ $W$ popularity)   \texttt{(inPopIntn)}\\

 for parameter $p = 2$ the square roots of the $W$-in-degrees:\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, ({w_{+j}} - {\bar w})  $ or\\

for $p=2$ \  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, (\sqrt{w_{j+}} - \sqrt{\bar w})$;\\[0.2em]

 \item {\em Effect of out-degree  in W on X-activity } ($X$: outdegree$^{1/p}$ $W$ activity) \texttt{(outActIntn)}\\
 defined by the $W$-out-degree of $i$ (for $p = 2$ its square root)
 times $i$'s $X$-out-degree:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, ({w_{i+}} - {\bar w}) =
                           x_{i+}\, ({w_{i+}} - {\bar w}) $ or\\[0.2em]

\end{enumerate}

The following four effects are meant mainly for interactions.
Recall from Section~\ref{S_int_eff} that interactions are defined by
the product of the change statistics.
In many cases, the change statistics are defined by omitting
$ \sum_j x_{ij}$ from the formula for the effect.
In Section~\ref{intint} we saw an example in which the ego effect of the
average value of covariate $V$ for those to whom actor $i$ has a $W$-outgoing tie
can be defined as the interaction between  \texttt{outActIntnX},
the effect of out-degree in $W$, weighted by receiver's $V$, on $X$-activity,
with  \texttt{divOutEgoIntn}. For a given ego, \texttt{outActIntnX} gives the
sum of the $V$-values of ego's $W$-ties, and \texttt{divOutEgoIntn} divides
this by the number of  ego's $W$-ties; this yields the average
of the $V$-values of ego's $W$-ties.

For such interaction effects, the internal effect parameters
should match; see Section~\ref{intint}.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}

 \item {\em 1 divided by ego's out-degree  in W } ($X$: 1/outdeg.$^{1/p}$ $W$ ego)

 (for $p = 2$ its square root),  or 0 if the $W$-out-degree is 0:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \text{divi}(1, w_{i+}) $ or\\[0.2em]
for $p=2$ \  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\,\text{divi}(1, \sqrt{w_{i+}})$;\\[0.2em]
where $\text{divi}(a,b)$ is defined as $a/b$ if $b \neq 0$ and 0 if $b=0$;


 \item {\em 1 divided by ego's in-degree  in W } ($X$: 1/indeg.$^{1/p}$ $W$ ego)
 \texttt{(divInEgoIntn)}\\
 defined by  $i$'s $X$-out-degree divided by the
  $W$-in-degree of $i$ (for $p = 2$ its square root),
 or 0 if the $W$-indegree is 0:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \text{divi}(1, w_{+i}) $ or\\[0.2em]

where $\text{divi}(a,b)$ is defined as above;


 \item {\em 1 divided by alter's out-degree  in W } ($X$: 1/outdeg.$^{1/p}$ $W$ alter)
 \texttt{(divOutAltIntn)}\\
 defined by 1 divided by the sum of the $W$-out-degrees of those
 to whom $i$ has an outgoing $X$-tie
 (for $p = 2$ its square root),  or 0 if the $W$-out-degree is 0:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \text{divi}(1, w_{j+}) $ or\\[0.2em]

where $\text{divi}(a,b)$ is defined as above;


 \item {\em 1 divided by alter's in-degree  in W } ($X$: 1/indeg.$^{1/p}$ $W$ alter)
 \texttt{(divInAltIntn)}\\
 defined by 1 divided by the sum of the $W$-out-degrees of those
 from whom $i$ has an incoming $X$-tie (for $p = 2$ its square root),
 or 0 if the $W$-indegree is 0:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \text{divi}(1, w_{+j}) $ or\\[0.2em]

where $\text{divi}(a,b)$ is defined as above;


 \item {\em Effect of average out-degree in W on X } ($X$: av.\ degree $W$)
 \texttt{(avDegIntn)}\\
 defined by the $X$-outdegree of $i$ multiplied by the
 average $W$-out-degree, centered by the internal effect parameter~$p$\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, \big( \frac 1n \sum_h  {w_{h+}} \,-\, p \big)=
                           x_{i+}\, \big( \frac 1n \sum_h w_{h+} \,-\, p \big) $ \, ;\\[0.2em]
  this effect is a network-by-period level effect and therefore is useful only
  for multigroup data sets or for data sets with many periods;\\
  it may be beneficial for convergence to use a value of $p$ that is
  close to the average $W$-degree (but constant, while this effect
  is for the dynamic average outdegree);

 \item {\em Interaction W $\times$ in-degree W activity } ($X$: $W$ x indegree$^{1/p}$ $W$ activity)
         \texttt{(crprodInActIntn)}\\
 defined by the entrainment of $W$ by $X$ weighted by $W$-in-degrees of $i$ (for $p = 2$ the square roots):\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, w_{ij}\,({w_{+i}} - {\bar w}) $ or\\[0.2em]
for $p=2$ \  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\,w_{ij}\, (\sqrt{w_{+i}} - \sqrt{\bar w}) $;\\[0.2em]

 \item {\em Effect of absolute difference of both W out-degrees} ($X$: outdegree$^{1/p}$ $W$ abs. diff.) \texttt{(absOutDiffIntn)}\\
 defined by   the sum of the absolute difference of the $W$-out-degrees of alter and ego
 for all alters to whom $i$ is tied;
 for parameter $p = 2$ the square roots of the $W$-out-degrees are taken:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
   \sum_j x_{ij}\, | w_{i+} - w_{j+} | $ or\\[0.2em]
for $p=2$ \  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\, | \sqrt{w_{i+}} - \sqrt{w_{j+} } | $;\\[0.2em]
 this can be regarded as minus the similarity of the $W$-out-degrees
 (but without the division by the range);

 \item {\em Effect of both in-degrees in W on X-popularity } ($X$: both indegrees$^{1/p}$ $W$ ) \texttt{(both)}\\
 defined by   the sum of  the $W$-in-degrees of the others to whom $i$ is tied
 multiplied by the centered $W$-in-degree of $i$,
 for parameter $p = 2$ the square roots of the $W$-in-degrees:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
   \sum_j x_{ij}\, ({w_{+i}} - {\bar w}) \, ({w_{+j}} - {\bar w})  $ or\\[0.2em]
for $p=2$ \  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\,
 (\sqrt{w_{+i}} - \sqrt{\bar w}) \, (\sqrt{w_{+j}} - \sqrt{\bar w})  $;\\[0.2em]
 this can be regarded as an interaction between the effect of $W$-in-degree on $X$-popularity
 and the effect of $W$-in-degree on $X$-activity;

 \item {\em Duplex XW out-degree activity effect } ($X$: duplex $W$ outdegree$^{1/p}$ activity)\\
    \texttt{(doubleOutAct)}\\
  which is like the out-degree activity effect, but now for the degrees in the
  joined $X$ \underline{and} $W$ network;
 for parameter $p = 2$ the square root of the out-degrees is taken:\\[0.4em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \big(\sum_j x_{ij}\,w_{ij} \big)^2  $ or\\[0.4em]
for $p=2$ \  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
        \sum_j x_{ij}\,w_{ij} \sqrt{\sum_h x_{ih}\,w_{ih}^{\phantom{0}} }  $\ ;\\

 \item {\em Duplex XW in-degree popularity effect } ($X$: duplex $W$ indegree$^{1/p}$ popularity)\\
    \texttt{(doubleInPop)}\\
  which is like the in-degree popularity effect, but now for the degrees in the
  joined $X$ \underline{and} $W$ network;
 for parameter $p = 2$ the square root of the out-degrees is taken:\\[0.4em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\,w_{ij}\sum_h x_{hj}\,w_{hj}   $ or\\[0.4em]
for $p=2$ \  $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =
        \sum_j x_{ij}\,w_{ij} \sqrt{\sum_h x_{hj}\,w_{hj}^{\phantom{0}} }  $\ .\\

The betweenness effect is another positional effect:
a positional characteristic in the $W$ network affects the
ties in the $X$ network, but now the position is the betweenness count,
defined as the number of pairs of nodes that are not directly connected:
 $j \stackrel{W}{\nrightarrow} h$ ,
but that are connected through $i$:
 $j \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} i  \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} h$ .
 Again there is an internal effect parameter $p$, usually
1 or 2.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}
 \item
{\em Effect of W-betweenness on X-popularity } ($X$: betweenness$^{1/p}$ $W$ popularity)  \\
 \texttt{(betweenPop)}
 defined by   the sum of  the $W$-betweenness counts of the others to whom $i$ is tied:\\[0.2em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij}\,

 \item {\em Jaccard similarity with respect to incoming $W$ ties effect} \texttt{(JinMix)},\\
 defined by
 the Jaccard similarity with respect to incoming $W$-ties,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  \sum_j x_{ij} \, J_{W,\, \text{in}}(i,j)$, where
 \[
 J_{W,\, \text{in}}(i,j) \,=\, \frac{\sum_h w_{hi}\,w_{hj}}
                     {w_{+i} + w_{+j} - \sum_h w_{hi}\,w_{hj}}
 \]
 (where again 0/0 is taken as 0).

 \item Five variations of mixed \emph{GWESP (geometrically weighted edgewise
  shared partners)} effects: \texttt{gwespFFMix, gwespBBMix,
  gwespFBMix, gwespBFMix, gwespRRMix}, and for non-directed
  and two-mode networks the sixth version \texttt{gwespMix}. \\
  See above for the GWESP effects for one-mode networks for their
  further background.
  These are geometrically downweighted analogues:
   \texttt{gwespFFMix} of \texttt{closure},
   \texttt{gwespBBMix} of \texttt{cyClosure},
  \texttt{gwespFBMix} of \texttt{from}, \texttt{gwespBFMix} of \texttt{sharedIn},
  and \texttt{gwespRRMix} of \texttt{fromMutual}.
  The \texttt{gwespFFMix} effect is defined by
\[
  \text{GWESPFF}(i, \alpha) \,=\,
       \sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij} \,
                        e^{\alpha} \,\Big\{1 \,-\, \big(1 -
                        e^{-\alpha}\big)^{\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{hj} }  \Big\}
      \,   \ ,
\]
where the convention is used that $w_{jj} = 0$ for all $j$.
See the figures above in the presentation of the \texttt{gwespFF}
effect.

The parameter $\alpha$ is a tuning parameter that may range from 0 to $\infty$.
The internal effect parameter is defined as $100 \times \alpha$.
An often used value is $\alpha = \log(2) = 0.69$ \citep{SPRH06},
corresponding to an internal effect parameter of 69,
but it is worthwhile to try out different values of $\alpha$
to see which one gives the best fit.
For large $\alpha$ the  \texttt{gwespFFMix} effect will
approximate the \texttt{closure} effect, and similarly for the
other correspondences mentioned above.

The other types of mixed GWESP effect are analogous, with
different tie orientations. They are defined as follows:\\
\texttt{gwespBBMix}: ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{hj} }$
is replaced by ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{hi}w_{jh} }$;\\[0.3em]
\texttt{gwespFBMix}: ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{hj} }$
is replaced by ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{jh} }$;\\[0.3em]
\texttt{gwespBFMix}: ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{hj} }$
is replaced by ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{hi}w_{hj} }$;\\[0.3em]
\texttt{gwespRRMix}: ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{hj} }$
is replaced by ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{hi}w_{jh}w_{hj} }$;\\[0.3em]
\texttt{gwespMix} for two-mode $W$:\ ${\sum_{h=1}^n w_{ih}w_{hj} }$
is replaced by ${\sum_{h=1}^m w_{ih}w_{jh} }$.

 The effect parameter $p$ can take the values 1, 2, 3 and 4.
  The value $c$, a constant for centering,
   is the average of the observed values $w_{ih}\, w_{kh}$:\\[0.5em]
 $ c \,=\, \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \big(1/Mn(n-1)\big)
               \sum_{m,h} \big( w_{+h}^2(t_m) - w_{+h}(t_m)\big) & (p \geq 3) \\[0.3em]

    \end{array} \right. $\\[0.5em]
 Note that since this is the evaluation function for actor $i$ with
 respect to network $X$, only the $x_{ij}$ tie indicator in the formula,
 corresponding to  the tie $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$,
 is the dependent variable here.\\
 The interpretation is that actors have the tendency to make the same
 outgoing $X$-choices as those ($k$) with whom they share many outgoing $W$-ties.\\
 For $p=2$ and $p=4$, the square root is taken: \\[0.3em]
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_{j,k; k \neq i} x_{ij}\, x_{kj}\,
 \Big( \sqrt{\sum_{h} w_{ih}\, w_{kh} } \,-\, \sqrt{c} \Big)\,$.\\

 This can be regarded as a higher-order effect related to indegree-popularity.
 The differences between the centered and non-centered versions amount to
 a multiple of the indegree-popularity (without $\sqrt{}$) \texttt{inPop} effect.
 Therefore, when the \texttt{sharedTo} effect is used, it is advisable
 also to include the \texttt{inPop} effect, so as to avoid misinterpretations.

\textbf{\emph{Dyadic covariate effects}}
\medskip

For dyadic covariate effects in models for evolution of multiple networks,
the convention with respect to letters has to be adapted.
For the rest, $W$ is used both to indicate dyadic covariates and networks
in their role as explanatory variables.
Now we use the letter $U$ to indicate the dyadic covariate,
$X$ to denote the network in the role of dependent variable, and $W$
the other network, having the role of explanatory variable.

 this refers to the closure of mixed $W-X$ two-paths,

 is proportional to
 the sum of mixed $W-X$ two-paths
 $i \stackrel{W}{\rightarrow} h \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$
 weighted by $u_{ih}$.\\
 This is an elementary effect for actor $i$:
 only the $x_{ij}$ tie indicator in the formula,
 corresponding to  the tie $i \stackrel{X}{\rightarrow} j$,
 is the dependent variable here.\\
 The interpretation is that actors have the tendency to make the same
 outgoing $X$-choices as those to whom they have a $W$-tie,
 weighted by $U$.
 This will usually be meaningful if $U$ is non-centered.

 This effect is a variant of the \texttt{sameWXClosure} effect,
 where the restriction is made that actors $i$ and $h$
 have the same value of a monadic covariate.

\textbf{\emph{Monadic covariate effects}}
\medskip

\noindent
The mixed degree-related effects can be weighted with monadic covariates $V$,
as implemented by the following four effects.
(For two-mode networks, these effects are meaningful only in special cases;
however, this is not checked when creating the effects object, so errors
can lead here to meaningless results or to crashes.)
Note that, unlike the unweighted effects
\texttt{inPopIntn, inActIntn, outPopIntn, outActIntn}, the $W$-degrees
here are not centered (well, they are also not really degrees).

Weights at the other side of the $W$-tie can be obtained by interactions of
\texttt{inPopIntn, inActIntn, outPopIntn, outActIntn} with the ego or
alter effects of $V$.
Different types of weighting are available through the distance-two
effects \texttt{altDist2W} and \texttt{totDist2W}, see below.

For these effects the other network $W$ is given as \texttt{interaction1},
and the covariate $V$ as \texttt{interaction2}.

These weighted effects are defined by \underline{sums} over all outgoing
or incoming $W$-ties. To obtain \underline{averages}, they can be interacted
by the appropriate one of  \texttt{divOutEgoIntn}, \texttt{divInEgoIntn},
\texttt{divOutAltIntn}, or \texttt{divInAltIntn}. The internal effect parameters
should match; see Section~\ref{intint}.

There are several effects similar to the `alter' and `similarity'
effects described above,
now depending on the auxiliary variable $\breve v_i$, `alters' $v$-average'.
Here the `alter' is defined, however, by the other network $W$.
Thus, \emph{$W$-alters' $v$-average} $\breve v_i^W$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
  \breve v_i^W = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_j w_{ij}v_j}{w_{i+}}  &  \text{ if } w_{i+} > 0     \\
         \bar v                                &  \text{ if } w_{i+} = 0  ,
  \end{array}   \right.            \label{alt_av_w}
\end{equation}
where $\bar v$ is the overall mean of variable $V$.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}

\item \emph{covariate - alter at W-distance 2} \texttt{(altDist2W)} \\ % \texttt{(altXDist2W)}.
      This effect is associated with an effect parameter
      which can have values 1 or 2.
      For parameter 1, it is
      defined as the sum of $W$-alters' covariate-average over all actors
      to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \breve v_j^W \hfill (\text{parameter 1}). \hfill
\]
      For parameter 2, it is defined similarly,
      but for an alters' covariate-average excluding
      ego:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \breve v_j^{W(-i)} \hfill (\text{parameter 2}) \hfill
\]
      where
\begin{equation}
  \breve v_j^{W(-i)} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_{h \neq j} w_{jh}v_h}{w_{j+} - w_{ji}}  &  \text{ if } w_{j+} - w_{ji} > 0     \\
         \bar v                               &  \text{ if } w_{j+}- w_{ji} = 0  .
  \end{array}   \right.
\end{equation}

\item \emph{total covariate - alter at W-distance 2} \texttt{(totDist2W)} \\
      This effect is like the previous effect, but now defined
      defined as the sum of $W$-alters' covariate-total over all actors
      to whom $i$ has a tie. For parameter 1 it is
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{j+} \, \breve v_j^W \hfill (\text{parameter 1}). \hfill
\]
      For parameter 2, it is defined similarly,
      but for an alters' covariate-total excluding
      ego:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \, (x_{j+}  - x_{ji}) \,
               \breve v_j^{W(-i)} \hfill (\text{parameter 2}) \hfill
\]
      where $ \breve v_j$ and $ \breve v_j^{W(-i)}$ are as above.

\item \emph{ego-(alter-W-distance-2) covariate - similarity} \texttt{(simEgoDist2W)},
      defined as the sum of centered similarity  between $i$
      and alters' covariate-average, for all actors
      $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \Big({\rm sim}(\grave v^W)_{ij}
  - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}\Big) \ ,
\]
 where the similarity scores ${\rm sim}(\grave v^W)_{ij}$ are defined as
\[
{\rm sim}(\grave v^W)_{ij}=
 \frac{\Delta-\vert  v^W_i - ( \breve v^W_j)^{(-i)} \vert}{\Delta} \ ,
\]
 while
 $\Delta=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ is the observed range of the
 \emph{original} covariate $v$,
 $ (\breve v^W_j)^{(-i)}$ is as above in effect \texttt{(altDist2W)},

 and $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is the mean of all similarity scores as used also
 for the \texttt{simX} effect; this centering is applied since version 1.1-285.
 For a constant covariate \texttt{mycov}, this mean is given by
 \texttt{attr(mydata\$cCovars\$mycov, "simMean")}.\\

 \item \emph{covariate - similarity at W-distance 2} \texttt{(simDist2W)}, % \texttt{(simXDist2W)},
      defined as the sum of centered similarity
      values for alters' covariate-average between $i$ and all actors
      $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \Big({\rm sim}(\breve v^W)_{ij}
  -  \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}\Big) \ ,
\]
 where the similarity scores ${\rm sim}(\breve v^W)_{ij}$ are defined as
\[
{\rm sim}(\breve v^W)_{ij}=
 \frac{\Delta-\vert \breve v_i^W - \breve v_j^W \vert}{\Delta} \ ,
\]
 while
 $\Delta=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ is the observed range of the
 \emph{original} covariate $v$, and\\
  $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is as above.



\item \emph{covariate - in-alter at W-distance 2} \texttt{(altInDist2W)} \\ % \texttt{(altXDist2W)}.
      This effect is associated with an effect parameter
      which can have values 1 or 2.
      For parameter 1, it is
      defined as the sum of $W$-in-alters' covariate-average over all actors
      to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \check v_j^W \hfill (\text{parameter 1}), \hfill
\]
      where
\begin{equation}
  \check v_j^W  = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_{h \neq i} w_{hj}\,v_h}{x_{+j} - x_{ij}}  &
                                       \text{ if } x_{+j} > 0     \\

  \end{array}   \right.            \label{alt_inav2}
\end{equation}
where $\bar v$ is (again) the global mean of $V$.

      For parameter 2, it is defined similarly,
      but for an alters' covariate-average excluding
      ego:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \check v_j^{W(-i)} \hfill (\text{parameter 2}) \hfill
\]
      where
\begin{equation}
  \check v_j^{W(-i)} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_{h \neq j} w_{hj}\, v_h}{w_{j+} - w_{ji}}  &  \text{ if } w_{+j} - w_{ij} > 0     \\
         \bar v                               &  \text{ if } w_{+j}- w_{ij} = 0  .
  \end{array}   \right.
\end{equation}

\item \emph{total covariate - in-alter at W-distance 2} \texttt{(totInDist2W)} \\
      This effect is like the previous effect, but now defined
      defined as the sum of $W$-in-alters' covariate-total over all actors
      to whom $i$ has a tie. For parameter 1 it is
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, x_{j+} \, \check v_j^W \hfill (\text{parameter 1}). \hfill
\]
      For parameter 2, it is defined similarly,
      but for an alters' covariate-total excluding
      ego:
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \, (x_{j+}  - x_{ji}) \,
               \check v_j^{W(-i)} \hfill (\text{parameter 2}) \hfill
\]
      where $ \check v_j$ and $ \check v_j^{W(-i)}$ are as above.

\item \emph{ego-(in-alter-W-distance-2) covariate - similarity} \texttt{(simEgoInDist2W)},
      defined as the sum of centered similarity  between $i$
      and alters' covariate-in-average, for all actors
      $j$ to whom $i$ has a tie,
\[
 s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\, \Big({\rm sim}(\acute v^W)_{ij}
  - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}\Big) \ ,
\]
 where the similarity scores ${\rm sim}(\acute v^W)_{ij}$ are defined as
\[
{\rm sim}(\acute v)_{ij}=
 \frac{\Delta-\vert  v_i - \check v_j^{(-i)} \vert}{\Delta} \ ,
\]
 while
 $ \check v_j^{(-i)}$ is as in the definition of \texttt{altInDist2W},
 $\Delta=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ is the observed range of the
 \emph{original} covariate $v$, and\\
 $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is as above.

The following is an effect for three networks:

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}
\item \emph{from $W$ agreement weighted by $Z$ indegrees} \texttt{(from.w.ind)},

\subsubsection{Network creation and endowment functions}
\label{S_c}
\label{S_e}

The \emph{network creation function}
is one way of modeling effects which operate in
different strengths for the creation and the dissolution of
relations.
The network creation function is zero for dissolution of ties,
and is given by
\begin{equation}
c^{\rm net}_i(x) \, = \, \sum_k \zeta_k^{\rm net} \, s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)
                             \label{c_net}
\end{equation}
for creation of ties.
In this formula, the $\zeta_k^{\rm net}$
are the parameters for the creation function.
The potential effects $s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x) $ in this function, and their
formulae, are the same as in the evaluation function;
except that not all are available, as indicated in the preceding subsection.
For further explication, consult \citet{Snijders01, Snijders05};
(here, the `gratification function' is used rather than the creation function),
\citet*{SnijdersEA07}, and \citet*{SteglichEA10}
(here only the endowment function is treated and not the creation function,
but they are similar in an opposite way).

The \emph{network endowment function}
is another way of modeling effects which operate in
different strengths for the creation and the dissolution of
relations.
The network endowment function is zero for creation of ties,
and is given by
\begin{equation}
e^{\rm net}(x) \, = \, \sum_k \gamma^{\rm net}_k \, s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)
                                                           \label{e_net}
\end{equation}
for dissolution of ties.
In this formula, the $\gamma_k^{\rm net}$
are the parameters for the endowment function.
The potential effects $s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x) $ in this function, and their
formulae, are the same as in the evaluation function;
except that not all are available, as indicated in the preceding subsection.
For further explication, consult \citet{Snijders01, Snijders05};
(here, the `gratification function' is used rather than the endowment function),
\citet*{SnijdersEA07}, and \citet*{SteglichEA10}.

A better term than endowment is perhaps \emph{maintenance}.


These functions are combined in the following way.
For the creation of ties, the objective function used is
\begin{equation}
f_i^{\rm net}(x) \,+\, c_i^{\rm net}(x)     \ ,             \label{fc_net}
\end{equation}
in other words, the parameters for the evaluation and creation effects are
added.
For the dissolution of ties, on the other hand, the objective function is
\begin{equation}
f_i^{\rm net}(x) \,+\, e_i^{\rm net}(x)      \ ,            \label{fe_net}
\end{equation}
in other words, the parameters for the evaluation and endowment effects are
added.
Therefore, a model with a parameter with some value $\beta_k$
for a given evaluation effect,
and for which there are no separate creation and endowment effects,
has exactly the same consequences as a model for which this
evaluation effect is excluded, and that includes a creation as well as
an endowment effect, both with the same parameter value
$\zeta_k = \beta_k$ and $\gamma_k = \beta_k$.

Of the three types of effect --- evaluation, creation, and endowment ---,
one therefore should use one or two, not all three, because this leads to collinearity.


\subsubsection{Network rate function} \label{S_r}

To define rate effects by the function \sfn{includeEffects} or \textsf{setEffect},
note that in the call of these functions the specification
\texttt{type = "rate"} should be included.
\medskip

The network rate function $\lambda^{\rm net}$
(lambda) is defined for Model Type~1 (which is the default Model
Type) as a product \[ \lambda^{\rm net}_i(\rho, \alpha, x, m) =
\lambda^{\rm net}_{i1} \lambda^{\rm net}_{i2} \lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}
\] of factors depending, respectively, on period $m$, actor
covariates, and actor position \citep[see][p.\ 383]{Snijders01}. The
corresponding factors in the rate function are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The dependence on the period \texttt{(Rate)}
 can be represented by a simple factor
 \[ \lambda^{\rm net}_{i1} = \rho^{\rm net}_m \]
 for $m = 1, ..., M-1$.\\
 This basic rate parameter is always period-dependent (i.e.,
 it may and will be different for
 different values of $m$); this is in contrast to all other parameters.

 \item The effect of actor covariates \texttt{(RateX)} with values
 $v_{hi}$ can be represented by the factor
 \[ \lambda^{\rm net}_{i2} = \exp(\sum_h \alpha_h \, v_{hi})\,. \]
   If $v_{h}$ is a behavior variable, the non-centered value is used.
% StatisticCalculator::calculateNetworkRateStatistics and DependentVariable::behaviorVariableRate
% see DependentVariable::behaviorVariableRate and StatisticCalculator::calculateBehaviorRateStatistics

 \item The dependence on the position of the actor can be modeled
 as a function of the actor's out-degree \texttt{(outRate)},
 in-degree \texttt{(inRate)}, and number
 of reciprocated relations \texttt{(recipRate)}, the `reciprocated degrees'.
 Define these by
 \[ x_{i+} \,=\, \sum_j x_{ij}, \phantom{abcde} x_{+i} \,=\, \sum_j x_{ji},
                \phantom{abcde} x_{i(r)} \,=\, \sum_j x_{ij}x_{ji} \]
 (recalling that $x_{ii} = 0$ for all $i$).\\

 \iffalse
 Denoting the corresponding parameter by $\alpha_1$, the dependence
 on the out-degree is represented by
 \[ \lambda^{\rm net}_{i3} = \frac{x_{i+}}{n-1} \exp(\alpha_1) \+
 \left(1 - \frac{x_{i+}}{n-1}\right) \exp(- \alpha_1). \]
 This formula is motivated in \citet{SnijdersDuijn97}.
 This defines a linear function of the out-degree,
 parametrized in such a way that it is necessarily positive.\\
 For a general dependence on the out-degree, in-degree, and number
 of reciprocated relations, one can use an average of such terms, the
 second and third one depending in the analogous way on
 $x_{+i}$ and $x_{i(r)}$, respectively.\\
 \fi

The contribution of the out-degrees to $\lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}$
is a factor
 \[ \exp( \alpha_h \, x_{i+})\,, \]
if the associated parameter is denoted $\alpha_h$ for some $h$,
and similarly for the contributions of the in-degrees and the
reciprocated degrees.

 Nonlinear dependence of the exponent on the degrees
 can also be specified:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item inverse outdegree effect  \texttt{(outRateInv)} \\
 Denoting again the corresponding parameter by $\alpha_h$
 (but always for different index numbers $h$),
 this effect multiplies the factor $\lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}$ by
 \[ \exp\big( \alpha_h / (x_{i+} +1)\big) \ . \]
 \item logarithmic outdegree effect  \texttt{(outRateLog)} \\
 This effect multiplies the factor $\lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}$ by
 \[ \exp\Big( \ln\big(\alpha_h (x_{i+} +1)\big)\Big) \,=\,
                 \big(x_{i+} +1\big)^{\alpha_h} \ . \]

 \item inverse indegree effect  \texttt{(inRateInv)} \\
 This effect multiplies the factor $\lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}$ by
 \[ \exp\big( \alpha_h / (x_{+i} +1)\big) \ . \]
 \item logarithmic indegree effect  \texttt{(inRateLog)} \\
 This effect multiplies the factor $\lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}$ by
 \[ \exp\Big( \ln\big(\alpha_h (x_{+i} +1)\big)\Big) \,=\,
                 \big(x_{+i} +1\big)^{\alpha_h} \ . \]


 \item inverse reciprocal degree effect  \texttt{(recipRateInv)} \\
 This effect multiplies the factor $\lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}$ by
 \[ \exp\big( \alpha_h / (x_{i(r)} +1)\big) \ . \]
 \item logarithmic reciprocal degree effect  \texttt{(recipRateLog)} \\
 This effect multiplies the factor $\lambda^{\rm net}_{i3}$ by
 \[ \exp\Big( \ln\big(\alpha_h (x_{i(r)} +1)\big)\Big) \,=\,
                 \big(x_{i(r)} +1\big)^{\alpha_h} \ . \]

 The exponential link function and logarithmic transformation collaborate
 to produce direct proportionality to (outdegree + 1) or (indegree + 1),
 respectively, in case the parameter is $\alpha_h=1$.
 \end{itemize}
 For these effects, the addition of 1 to the degrees avoids
 problems (division by 0, logarithm of 0) that otherwise would occur
 when $ x_{i+} = 0$ or $ x_{+i} = 0$ .

 For making the rates dependent on the degrees,
 the  logarithmic effects often give the best fit.

 \emph{These effects work properly only for non-conditional estimation
    (set \texttt{cond = FALSE} in \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate}).  }
\end{enumerate}

When rate effects are included, sometimes it can be helpful to specify
a smaller value for the initial gain parameter in \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate};
e.g., \texttt{firstg = 0.01} or even  \texttt{firstg = 0.001}.
When the estimation algorithm diverges and any rate effects are in the model,
this option should be considered.
With a smaller \texttt{firstg} parameter convergence will be slower, but also
there is a smaller probability that the parameter will diverge accidentally.

\iffalse
\subsubsection{Network rate function for Model Type 2}

For Model Type 2 (see Section~\ref{S_modeltype}), the network rate
function is defined according to \citet{Snijders03} by
\begin{align*}
  \rho_m\, \lambda_{i+}(s) & =
               \rho_m\,\frac{\nu(s)\, \xi(s)}{1 \,+\, \xi(s)}\, , \\
  \rho_m\, \lambda_{i-}(s) & =   \rho_m\, \frac{\nu(s-1)}{1 \,+\, \xi(s-1)} \ ,
\end{align*}
where $ \rho_m\,\lambda_{i+}(s)$ and $ \rho_m\,\lambda_{i-}(s)$
represent, respectively, the rate at which an actor of current
out-degree $s$ increases, or decreases, his out-degree by 1. The
parameter $\rho_m$ is a multiplicative effect of the observation
period.

Function $\xi$ (\emph{xi}) is called the distributional tendency
function and is represented according to \citet[formula (17)]{Snijders03} by
\[ \xi(s) \,=\, \exp\left(\alpha_1 \,-\, \alpha_2 \log(s+1) - \frac{\alpha_3}{s+1}\right)  \ . \]
where the names given in \RS are
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\alpha_1$ : out-degrees effect;
 \item $\alpha_2$ : logarithmic out-degree effect;
 \item $\alpha_3$ : factorial out-degree effect.
\end{itemize}
The reasons for these names and interpretation of the effects
can be found in \citet{Snijders03}.
To the exponent also effects of actor covariates can be added.

The so-called volatility function $\nu$ (\emph{nu}) is defined as
\[ \nu(s) \,=\, \left( 1 \,+\, \alpha_4 \, \frac{1}{s+1} \right) \ . \]
Also to this exponent effects of actor covariates can be added.
\fi

\subsection{Behavioral evolution}
\label{S_ff_b}

The model of the dynamics of a dependent actor variable
consists of a model of actors' decisions (according to {\it
evaluation}, {\it creation}, and {\it endowment functions})
and a model of the timing
of these decisions (according to a {\it rate function}),
just like the model for the network dynamics. The
decisions now do not concern the creation or dissolution of
network ties, but whether an actor increases or decreases his
score on the dependent actor variable by one, or keeps it as it
is.

\subsubsection{Behavioral evaluation function}
\label{S_f_b}

The behavior evaluation function for actor $i$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
f^{\rm beh}_i(x, z) \, = \, \sum_k \beta^{\rm beh}_k s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x, z)
                                             \label{f_beh}
\end{equation}
where $\beta^{\rm beh}_k$ are parameters and $s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x, z)$
are effects as defined below.
The behavioral dependent variable is denoted by $z$ and the
dependent network variable by $x$.
Here the dependent variable is transformed
to have an overall average value of 0;
in other words, $z$ denotes the original input variable
minus the overall mean\footnote{More precisely: \label{meandef}
this is the mean of the means per wave, and the
means per wave are means of the non-missing observations
for that wave.}, which is given in the
output file produced by \sfn{print01Report} under the heading
\emph{Reading dependent actor variables}.

First there are effects that have to do only
with the behavioral variable itself.

\begin{startenum}
 \item {\em behavioral shape effect} \texttt{(linear)},\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \,$ ,\\
 where $z_{i}$ denotes the value of the dependent behavior variable
 of actor $i$;

 \item {\em quadratic shape effect, or effect of the behavior upon itself}
                                                             \texttt{(quad)},
 where the attractiveness of further steps up the behavior `ladder'
 depends on where the actor is on the ladder:\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =  z_i^2 \,$ ;\\
 note that here $z_i$ is the
 \underline{centered} dependent behavioral variable;

 \item {\em threshold shape effect}    \texttt{(threshold)},
  \texttt{(threshold2)},  \texttt{(threshold3)},  \texttt{(threshold4)},
 where the attractiveness of the behavior depends on
 whether it is larger than the internal effect parameter $p$:\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =  I\{ z_i \geq p\}$ ;\\
 note that by exception $z_i$ here is the
 \underline{uncentered} dependent behavioral variable!
 Multiple versions of this effect are available to allow the use
 of more than one threshold.

 \item {\em $p$-near similarity effect} \texttt{(simAllNear)},\\
  $  s_{i\vit}(z) \,=\, \sum_{j\neq i}  \big(  \max\{ p \,-\, | z_j - z_i |, \,0  \} \big)
        \,=\, \sum_{j\neq i}   I\{ | z_j - z_i | \leq p\} \, \big(p \,-\, | z_j - z_i |\big) $\\
 where $p \geq 1$ is an internal effect parameter;
 note that this is an influence effect from \underline{all} actors in the network,
 which does not take a network into account;


 \item {\em $p$-far similarity effect} \texttt{(simAllFar)},\\
  $ s_{i\vit}(z) \,=\,  \sum_{j\neq i}  \min \{ p \,-\, | z_j - z_i | , \, 0 \}
        \,=\,  \sum_{j\neq i}   I\{ | z_j - z_i | \geq p\} \,  \big( p \,-\, | z_j - z_i | \big) $\\
 where $p \geq 1$ is an internal effect parameter;
 note that this also is an influence effect from \underline{all} actors in the network,
 which does not take a network into account;

 \item {\em group average} \texttt{(avGroup)}, defined by ego's value multiplied by the
 average of \underline{all} values $z_h$ for this period,  \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =  z_{i} \,( \overline {z} - c_p) $;\\
 here $\overline {z}$ is the mean of the values $z_h$ for all actors $h$
 in the group, and $c_p$ is a centering constant depending on the internal effect parameter $p$.
 Denote the overall mean used for centering the observed $Z$ values by
 $m_Z$ (see the footnote on p.~\pageref{meandef}).
 If $p \leq 0.5$, centering is no different than for the $z_i$ values generally,
 so $c_p = 0$; if $p > 0.5$, centering is by $c_p = p - m_Z$.
 For the original non-centered values of $Z$, this means that the mean
 is centered around the value $p$, the effect parameter itself.
 Note that this can be any real value, not necessarily integer.\\
 This effect is useful especially for multi-group data sets, where the average value
 varies between groups. For multi-group data sets, centering by the groupwise
 mean may be less desirable, and it will be better to center by a value $p$
 close to the median of $Z$.
 (Note that the centering in a multi-group data set
 will affect the linear shape parameter.)


 \item {\em constant effect}    \texttt{(constant)},\\
  an elementary effect for behavior,
  indicating that the behavior stays constant: \\
   $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z^0, z) =  I\{ z_i =  z^0_i \}  $ .\\
   The advice for this effect is not to use it,
   unless you have very specific reasons.\\
   For estimation, this effect is totally collinear with the rate
   effect; therefore its parameter cannot be estimated. It is only of theoretical
   importance, and can be used perhaps in interaction with other effects.
\end{startenum}
Next there is a list of effects that have to do with the influence of
the network on the behavior.
To specify such effects in \RS using, e.g., function \sfn{includeEffects},
it is necessary\footnote{If this behavior variable is the only dependent
variable, then this is not necessary. But this seldom happens.}
to specify the dependent behavior variable
in the keyword \sfn{name}
as well as the network in the keyword \sfn{interaction1}.
For example,
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
  myCoEvolutionEff <- includeEffects(myCoEvolutionEff, name = "drinkingbeh",
                                     avSim, indeg, outdeg,
                                     interaction1 = "friendship")
\end{verbatim}
}
The list of these effects is the following.
\begin{followenum}
 \item {\em average similarity effect} \texttt{(avSim)}, defined by the
 average of centered similarity scores ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ between $i$
 and the other actors $j$ to whom he is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = x_{i+}^{-1} \,
           \sum_j x_{ij} ({\rm sim}^z_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^z}) $;\\
 (and 0 if $x_{i+} = 0$) ;\\
 the definition of ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ is discussed in
 section~\ref{S_internal}, see (\ref{simV});

 \item {\em total similarity effect} \texttt{(totSim)}, defined by the
 sum of centered similarity scores ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ between $i$
 and the other actors $j$ to whom he is tied,\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =
            \sum_j x_{ij} ({\rm sim}^z_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^z}) $;\\
 it may be helpful for estimating this effect also to include the
 \texttt{outdeg} effect, with which it is correlated;


 \item {\em average incoming similarity effect} \texttt{(avInSim)}, defined by the
 average of centered similarity scores ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ between $i$
 and the other actors $j$ who send a tie to $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = x_{+i}^{-1} \,
           \sum_j x_{ji} ({\rm sim}^z_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^z}) $;\\
 (and 0 if $x_{+i} = 0$) ;

 \item {\em total incoming similarity effect} \texttt{(totInSim)}, defined by the
 sum of centered similarity scores ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ between $i$
 and the other actors $j$ who send a tie to $i$,\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =
            \sum_j x_{ji} ({\rm sim}^z_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^z}) $;

 \item {\em indegree effect} \texttt{(indeg)}, \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \sum_j x_{ji} $;

 \item {\em outdegree effect} \texttt{(outdeg)}, \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \sum_j x_{ij} $;

\item {\em reciprocated degree effect} \texttt{(recipDeg)}, \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \sum_j x_{ij}\,x_{ji} $;

% \item {\em indegree up to $p$ effect}, where $p$ is a constant between 1 and $n-1$,\\
% $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i I\{x_{+i} \leq p\}$,\\
% where again $I\{A\}$ denotes the indicator function of the condition $A$;

 \item {\em in-isolate effect} \texttt{(isolate)},
  the differential attractiveness of the behavior for in-isolates, \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i\, I\{x_{+i} = 0 \}$,\\
 where again $I\{A\}$ denotes the indicator function of the condition $A$;\\
 (before version 1.2-16 this was called the  {\em isolate effect};)

 \item {\em out-isolate effect} \texttt{(outIsolate)},
  the differential attractiveness of the behavior for out-isolates, \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i\, I\{x_{i+} = 0 \}$,\\
 where $I\{A\}$ still denotes the indicator function of the condition $A$;

 \item
 {\em average similarity $\times$ reciprocity effect} \texttt{(avSimRecip)},
 defined by the sum of centered similarity scores
 ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ between $i$
 and the other actors $j$ to whom he is reciprocally tied,\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = x_{i(r)}^{-1} \,
            \sum_j x_{ij} x_{ji} ({\rm sim}^z_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^z}) $;\\
 (and 0 if $x_{i(r)} = 0$) ;

 \item {\em total similarity $\times$ reciprocity effect}
 \texttt{(totSimRecip)}, defined by the
 sum of centered similarity scores ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ between $i$

\textbf{\emph{Monadic covariate effects}}
\medskip

\noindent
For each actor-dependent covariate $v_j$ (recall that by default these are
centered internally by \si) as well as for each of the other
dependent behavior variables (for notational simplicity here also
denoted $v_j$), there are the following effects.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{savenumi}}
 \item {\em main covariate effect} \texttt{(effFrom)},\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_{i} v_{i}\,$;\\
 here too, the other dependent behavioral variables are centered so that they
 have overall mean 0;

\item \emph{alter's covariate average } effect on behavior $z$
 \texttt{(avXAlt)}, formerly called \texttt{(AltsAvAlt)},\\
      defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
      $i$'s alters' covariate-average $\breve v_i$ as defined
      in (\ref{alt_av}),\\
       $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \, \breve v_i $.\\
      This is similar to the `average alter' effect; for
      $v_i = z_i$ it would reduce to the latter effect.

\item \emph{alter's covariate total } effect on behavior $z$
 \texttt{(totXAlt)},\\
      defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
      $i$'s alters' covariate sum $x_{i+}\,\breve v_i$ as defined
      in (\ref{alt_av}),\\
       $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \, x_{i+}\, \breve v_i $.\\
      This is similar to the `total alter' effect; for
      $v_i = z_i$ it would reduce to the latter effect.


 \item {\em maximum alter's covariate effect} \texttt{(maxXAlt)},
 defined by  $i$'s
 behavior multiplied by the maximum covariate value of his alters, \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =  z_i \big( \text{max}_j \, x_{ij}\, v_j \big) $\\
 (and the mean covariate if $\sum_j x_{ij} = 0$) ;

 \item {\em minimum alter's covariate effect} \texttt{(minXAlt)},
 defined by  $i$'s
 behavior multiplied by the minimum covariate value of his alters, \\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) =  z_i \big( \text{min}_j \, x_{ij}\, v_j \big) $\\
 (and the mean covariate if $\sum_j x_{ij} = 0$) ;



\item {\em absolute contrast outdegree -- covariate}
 \texttt{(degAbsContrX)},
 defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
 the absolute difference between $i$'s out-degree and his covariate value,\\
 $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = \ z_i \, \mid x_{i+} \,-\, v_i  \mid $;\\
 working with a non-centered covariate may be advisable for this effect;

\item {\em positive contrast outdegree -- covariate}
 \texttt{(degPosContrX)},
 defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
 the positive part of the difference between $i$'s out-degree
 and her covariate value,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) = \ z_i \, \max \{ x_{i+} \,-\,  v_i   ,\, 0 \} $;\\
 working with a non-centered covariate may be advisable for this effect;

\item {\em negative contrast outdegree -- covariate}
 \texttt{(degNegContrX)},
 defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
 the negative part of the difference between $i$'s out-degree
 and her covariate value,\\
 $s^{\rm net}_{i\vit}(x) =  - \, z_i \, \min \{ x_{i+} \,-\, v_i   ,\, 0 \}
 \,=\, z_i \, \max \{  v_i  \,-\, x_{i+} ,\, 0 \}  $;\\
 working with a non-centered covariate may be advisable for this effect;


\item \emph{alter's covariate total } effect on behavior $z$
 \texttt{(totXAlt)},\\
      defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
      $i$'s alters' covariate sum $x_{i+}\,\breve v_i$ as defined
      in (\ref{alt_avwa}),\\
       $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \, x_{i+}\, \breve v_i $.\\
      This is similar to the `total alter' effect; for
      $v_i = z_i$ it would reduce to the latter effect.

\item \emph{in-alter's covariate average } effect on behavior $z$
 \texttt{(avXInAlt)},\\
      defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
      $i$'s in-alters' covariate-average $\breve v_i$ as defined
      in
\begin{equation}
  \check v_i = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle
         \frac{\sum_j x_{ji}v_j}{x_{+i}}  &  \text{ if } x_{+i} > 0     \\

  \end{array}   \right.            \label{inalt_av}
\end{equation}
      the effect being \\
       $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \, \check v_i $.\\
      This is similar to the `average in-alter' effect; for
      $v_i = z_i$ it would reduce to the latter effect.

\item \emph{in-alter's covariate total } effect on behavior $z$
 \texttt{(totXInAlt)},\\
      defined as the product of $i$'s behavior $z_i$ and
      $i$'s alters' covariate sum $x_{i+}\,\check v_i$ as defined
      in (\ref{inalt_av}),\\
       $s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = z_i \, x_{i+}\, \check v_i $.\\
      This is similar to the `total in-alter' effect; for
      $v_i = z_i$ it would reduce to the latter effect.

\setcounter{savenumi}{\value{enumi}}
\end{enumerate}
There are also a number of interaction effects between actor covariates
(which includes other dependent behavior variables; note that these are used
in their \underline{centered} versions) and influence effects.
These have to be specified using \texttt{interaction1} for the covariate
and \texttt{interaction2} for the network, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
myCoevolutionEff <- includeEffects(myCoevolutionEff, avAltEgoX,
        name = "smoking",  interaction1 = "sex", interaction2 = "friendship")
\end{verbatim}
Between parentheses: the functionality of the `ego'-variant of these effects is duplicated by
interaction effects created, for example, as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
myCoevolutionEff <- includeInteraction(myCoevolutionEff, effFrom, avAlt,
        name = "smoking", interaction1 = c("sex", "friendship"))
\end{verbatim}
Furthermore, note that when the same dependent variable is used
(i.e., \texttt{name} and \texttt{interaction1} are the same),
the dependent variable is used as a weight with its value
before the ministep, and the potential change is not taken into account;
this departs from the concept of evaluation effect,
and is a case of an elementary effect.

For the `alter'-variant, this way of construction will not work because the
effect statistic cannot be decomposed into a product of two ego-level statistics.
The available effects of this type are the following.

\textbf{\emph{User-defined interaction effects}}
\medskip

\noindent

The \emph{user-defined interaction effects} of Section~\ref{S_beh_infl}
are defined as follows.
Suppose we consider two effects $s^{\rm beh}_{ia}(x, z)$ and
$s^{\rm beh}_{ib}(x, z)$. Then their interaction effect is defined by
\begin{equation}
    s^{\rm beh}_{i [a\ast b] }(x, z) \,=\,
      \frac{1}{z_i} \, s^{\rm beh}_{ia}(x, z) \, s^{\rm beh}_{ib}(x, z) \ .
\end{equation}
For three effects $s^{\rm beh}_{ia}(x, z)$,
$s^{\rm beh}_{ib}(x, z)$ and $s^{\rm beh}_{ic}(x, z)$,
the interaction effect is defined by
\begin{equation}
    s^{\rm beh}_{i [a\ast b \ast c] }(x, z) \,=\,
      \frac{1}{z_i^2} \, s^{\rm beh}_{ia}(x, z) \,
                      s^{\rm beh}_{ib}(x, z) \, s^{\rm beh}_{ic}(x, z)\ .
\end{equation}
The division by $z_i$ or $z_i^2$, respectively, is necessary to offset the
fact that all behavior effects of \texttt{interactionType = OK} contain
a factor $z_i$, and further do not depend on $z_i$.
For example, the interaction between two main effects (\texttt{effFrom})
of actor covariates $v_{1i}$ and $v_{2i}$, is the same as
the main effect of the product variable $v_{1i}\times v_{2i}$,
with the proviso that the user-defined interaction does not center
the product variable;  the user-defined interaction
then is defined by
\begin{equation}
    s^{\rm beh}_{i [v_1\ast v_2] }(x, z) \,=\,
              \frac{1}{z_i}\, ( z_i \, v_{1i})  \, ( z_i \, v_{2i}) \,=\,
                      z_i \, v_{1i}\,v_{2i}  \ ,
\end{equation}
where both component variables $v_{1i}$ and $v_{2i}$
are internally centered, but the product variable will generally not have
mean 0.


\subsubsection{Behavioral creation function}
Also the behavioral model knows the distinction between evaluation,
creation, and
endowment effects. The formulae of the effects that can be included
in the behavioral creation function $c^{\rm beh}$ are the same as
those given for the behavioral evaluation function. However, they enter
calculation of the creation function only when the actor considers
increasing his behavioral score by one unit (downward steps), not
when downward steps (or no change) are considered. For more details,
consult
\citet*{SnijdersEA07} and \citet*{SteglichEA10}
and replace `going down' by `going up'.

The statistics reported as \emph{inc.\ beh.} (increase in behavior)
are the sums of the changes in actor-dependent values
for only those actors who increased in behavior.
More precisely, it is
\begin{equation}
\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} \sum_{i=1}^n I\{z_{i}(t_{m+1}) > z_{i}(t_m) \}\,
     \big( s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x(t_{m+1})) -  s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x(t_m))   \big) ,
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the number of observations, $x(t_m)$ is the observed situation
at observation $m$, and the indicator function
$I\{A\}$ is 0 if event $A$ is true
and 0 if it is untrue.

\subsubsection{Behavioral endowment function}
Also the behavioral model knows the distinction between evaluation and
endowment effects. The formulae of the effects that can be included
in the behavioral endowment function $e^{\rm beh}$ are the same as
those given for the behavioral evaluation function. However, they enter
calculation of the endowment function only when the actor considers
decreasing his behavioral score by one unit (downward steps), not
when upward steps (or no change) are considered. For more details,
consult
\citet*{SnijdersEA07} and
\citet*{SteglichEA10}.

The statistics reported as \emph{dec.\ beh.} (decrease in behavior)
are the sums of the changes in actor-dependent values
for only those actors who decreased in behavior.
More precisely, it is
\begin{equation}
\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} \sum_{i=1}^n I\{z_{i}(t_{m+1}) < z_{i}(t_m) \}\,
     \big( s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x(t_{m})) -  s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x(t_{m+1}))   \big) ,
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the number of observations, $x(t_m)$ is the observed situation
at observation $m$, and the indicator function
$I\{A\}$ is 0 if event $A$ is true
and 0 if it is untrue.

\subsubsection{Behavioral rate function}
\label{S_behRate}

The behavioral rate function $\lambda^{\rm beh}$ consists of a
constant term per period, \[ \lambda^{\rm beh}_{i} = \rho^{\rm
beh}_m \] for $m = 1, ..., M-1$, which can be called the basic rate;
multiplied potentially by the following further effects.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The dependence on the position of the actor can be modeled
 as a function of the actor's out-degree \texttt{(outRate)},
 in-degree \texttt{(inRate)}, and number
 of reciprocated relations \texttt{(recipRate)}, the `reciprocated degrees'.
 These can be defined by
 \[ x_{i+} \,=\, \sum_j x_{ij}, \phantom{abcde} x_{+i} \,=\, \sum_j x_{ji},
                \phantom{abcde} x_{i(r)} \,=\, \sum_j x_{ij}x_{ji} \]
 (recalling that $x_{ii} = 0$ for all $i$).

The contribution of the out-degrees to the rate function
is a factor
 \[ \exp( \alpha_h \, x_{i+})\,, \]
if the associated parameter is denoted $\alpha_h$ for some $h$,
and similarly for the contributions of the in-degrees and the
reciprocated degrees.

 \item The dependence on actor covariates or behavioral variables
 \texttt{(RateX)} with values $v_{hi}$ multiplies the rate by a factor
 \[ \exp(\alpha_h \, v_{hi})\,. \]
   If $v_{h}$ is a behavioral variable, the non-centered value is used.
% see DependentVariable::behaviorVariableRate and StatisticCalculator::calculateBehaviorRateStatistics


 \item[{\hspace*{-1ex}$\bigodot$}]
 For the analysis of diffusion of innovations,
  which is applicable if the behavior variable
  is a non-decreasing variable with values 0 and 1,
  there are various contagion effects that render a model that
  would reduce to a proportional hazards model if the network
  were constant; see \citet{Greenan15}.
  This holds if they are part of the rate function,
  but not if they are included in the evaluation function.
  This also holds for effects depending on actor covariates.
  For all these effects, the rate function is multiplied by
 \[ \exp\big( \alpha_h \, a_{ih}(x)\big)\,, \]
 if the associated parameter is denoted $\alpha_h$ for some $h$,
 and the effect is $a_{ih}(x)$.

 The dependence on the internal effect parameter $p$ is similar for all
 these diffusion effects, and is described after the
  \verb|susceptAvCovar| effect.

 For models including these effects, it is recommended to use
 an algorithm that leads to smaller step sizes, i.e.,
 with a value for \texttt{firstg} lower than the default of 0.2.

\item \emph{average exposure effect} (\verb|avExposure|),
  defined as the proportion of $i$'s alters who have adopted the innovation,
\[
a_{i\vit}(y) \, = \, \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n z_j\, x_{ij} }{\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}};
\]

\item \emph{total exposure effect} (\verb|totExposure|), defined as the
 number of $i$'s alters who have adopted the innovation,
\[
a_{i\vit}(y) \,=\, \sum_{j=1}^n z_j\, x_{ij} ;
\]
\item \emph{infection by indegree effect} (\verb|infectIn|),
  defined as the sum of indegrees of $i$'s alters who are also adopters of the innovation,
\[
a_{i\vit}(y) \, =\, \sum_{j=1}^n z_j \,x_{ij}\, x_{+j};
\]
  for non-directed networks this is called the
   \emph{infection by degree effect} (\verb|infectDeg|);
\item \emph{infection by outdegree effect} (\verb|infectOut|),
 defined as the sum of outdegrees of $i$'s alters who are also adopters of the innovation,
\[
a_{i\vit}(y)\, = \, \sum_{j=1}^n z_j\, x_{ij}\, x_{j+};
\]
\item \emph{infection by covariate effect} (\verb|infectCovar|),
 defined as the sum of covariate values of $i$'s alters who are also adopters of the innovation,
\[
a_{i\vit}(y)\, =\, \sum_{j=1}^n z_j\, x_{ij}\, v_j;
\]
\item \emph{susceptibility to average exposure by indegree effect}
 (\verb|susceptAvIn|),
 defined as the interaction between $i$'s indegree and $i$'s average exposure,
\[
a_{i\vit}(y)\, = \,x_{+i} \, \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n z_j\, x_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}};
\]
  for non-directed networks the equivalent effect is \verb|totExposure|;

\item \emph{susceptibility to average exposure by covariate effect}
 (\verb|susceptAvCovar|),
  defined as the interaction between $i$'s covariate value and $i$'s  average exposure,
\[
a_{i\vit}(y) \, = \, v_{i} \, \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n z_j\, x_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}}.
\]

\end{enumerate}

For all  these diffusion effects there is an additional dependence
on the internal effect parameter $p$; the formulae given above are the default,
valid for $p=0$.

The parameter $p$ must be integer-valued. If $p > 0$, the contribution is
changed to $a_{i\vit}(y) = 0$ if less than $p$ alters
have adopted the innovation, i.e., if
\[
\sum_{j=1}^n  z_j\, x_{ij} \, < \, p \ .
\]
E.g., if $p=3$, then there is influence on actor $i$ only if
this actor has at least three alters who have adopted the innovation.

For the effects \verb|avExposure|, \verb|totExposure|, \verb|susceptAvIn|,
and \verb|susceptAvCovar|, \\
if $p < 0$,
the same rule is applied with the minimum $|p|$, but if there
are more than $|p|$ alters who have adopted the innovation,
only the value $|p|$ is used.
This means that for $p < 0$,
$\sum_{j=1}^n  z_j\, x_{ij}$ in the formula for
 $a_{ik}(y) $ is replaced by
 \[
 \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                0 & \text{  if  } \sum_{j=1}^n  z_j\, x_{ij} < |p| \\[0.9ex]
                |p| & \text{  if  } \sum_{j=1}^n  z_j\, x_{ij} \geq |p| \ .
     \end{array} \right.
 \]

\subsection{Effects for estimation by Generalized Method of Moments}

A variety of effects can be specified with \texttt{type = "gmm"},
as shown in \textsf{effectsDocumentation}.
These are not effects for the definition of the probability model,
but for the estimation by the Generalized Method of Moments.
This is documented in Section~\ref{S_GMoM}.

\newpage
\section{Parameter interpretation}
\label{S_interpret}

The main `driving force' of the actor-oriented model
is the evaluation function
(extended with the creation and/or endowment function, if these are
part of the model specification).
For the network, this is given in formula (\ref{f_net}) as
\[
f^{\rm net}_i(x) \, = \, \sum_k \beta^{\rm net}_k \, s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)   \ .
\]
The evaluation function can be regarded as the `attractiveness"
of the network (or behavior, respectively) for a given actor.
For getting a feeling of what are small and large values,
is is helpful to note that the evaluation functions are
used to compare how attractive various different tie changes are,
and for this purpose random disturbances are added
to the values of the evaluation function with standard deviations
equal\footnote{More exactly, the value is $\sqrt{\pi^2/6}$,
the standard deviation of the Gumbel
distribution; see \citet{Snijders01}.} to 1.28.

An alternative interpretation is that when actor $i$ is making
a `ministep', i.e., a single change in his outgoing ties
(where no change also is an option), and
$x_a$ and $x_b$ are two possible results of this ministep,
then $f^{\rm net}_i(x_b) - f^{\rm net}_i(x_a)$ is the log odds ratio
for choosing between these two alternatives -- so that the ratio
of the probability of $x_b$ and $x_a$ as next states is
\[
  \exp\big(f^{\rm net}_i(x_b) - f^{\rm net}_i(x_a)\big) \ .
\]
Note that, when the current state is $x$, the possibilities
for $x_a$ and $x_b$ are $x$ itself (no change), or $x$ with one extra
outgoing tie from $i$, or $x$ with one fewer outgoing tie from $i$.
Explanations about log odds ratios can be found
in texts about logistic regression and loglinear models.
For dependent behavior variables, the interpretation is similar,
keeping in mind that permitted changes in the behavior variable are
--1, 0, and +1 (as far as these changes do not lead beyond the
permitted range).

If one wishes an extremely short description of what the parameters
of the objective function stand for, one could write
`non-standardized contributions to log-probabilities'
as a shorthand for
`contributions to log-probabilities of increasing the
dependent variable by 1~unit when the effect is increased by 1~unit'.
Here the dependent variable is either the tie variable $X_{ij}$
or the behavior variable $Z_i$; the effect is $s_{ik}(x)$.



\subsection{Networks}

The evaluation function is a weighted sum of `effects'
$s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)$.
Their formulae can be found in Section~\ref{S_f}.
These formulae, however, are defined as a function of the whole
network $x$, and in most cases the contribution of a single tie
variable $x_{ij}$ is just a simple component of this formula.
The contribution to $s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)$
of adding the tie $i \rightarrow h$ minus the
contribution of adding the tie $i \rightarrow j$ is the log probability ratio
comparing the probabilities of $i$ sending a new tie to $h$ versus
sending the tie to $j$, if all other effects $s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x)$
yield the same values for these two hypothetical new configurations.

For example, suppose that actors $j$ and $h$,
actual or potential relation partners of actor $i$,
have exactly the same network
position and the same values on all variables included in the model,
except that for some actor variable $V$ for which only the
popularity (alter) effect is included in the model,
actor $h$ is one unit higher than actor $j$: $v_h = v_j + 1$.
It can be seen in Section~\ref{S_f} that
the popularity (alter) effect is defined as
\[
s^{\rm net}_{ik}(x) \, = \,  \sum_j x_{ij}\, v_j \ .
\]
The contribution to this formula made by a single tie variable,
i.e., the difference made by filling in $x_{ij} = 1$ or $x_{ij} = 0$
in this formula, is just $v_j$.
Let us denote the weight of the $V$-alter effect by $\beta_k$.
Then, the difference between extending a tie to $h$ or to $j$
that follows from the $V$-alter effect is
$\beta_k \times (v_h - v_j) = \beta_k \times 1 = \beta_k$.

Thus, in this situation, $\beta_k$ is the log probability ratio of the probability
that $h$ is chosen compared to the probability that $j$ is chosen.
E.g., if $i$ currently has a tie neither to $j$ nor to $h$,
and supposing that $\beta_k = 0.3$, the probability for $i$ to
extend a new tie to $h$ is $e^{0.3} = 1.35$ times as high
as the probability for $i$ to extend a new tie to $j$.

\subsection{Behavior}

The evaluation function for behavior is given by
\[
f^{\rm beh}_i(x, z) \, = \, \sum_k \beta^{\rm beh}_k s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x, z) \ ,
\]
see (\ref{f_beh}).
In many cases\footnote{For effects satisfying this condition,
the \texttt{interactionType} is defined as \texttt{"OK"}.}
the effect has the form of a product
\begin{equation}
s^{\rm beh}_{ik}(x, z) \,=\, z_i \,s^{0}_{ik}(x, z) \ ,  \label{beh_generic}
\end{equation}
where $s^{0}_{ik}(x, z)$ is not dependent on $z_i$
(although it might depend on $z_j$ for other actors $j$), and therefore
would not be affected by the outcome of a behavior ministep of actor $i$.
Examples are the main effect of an actor attribute, but also the
average alter effect.
For such effects,
when a ministep in behavior occurs, the contribution
on the probability distribution of the change is as follows:
a change of $z_i $ by --1 will decrease the evaluation function by
$\beta^{\rm beh}_k s^{0}_{ik}(x, z)$,
and a change by +1 will increase it by the same amount.
(Note that this amount does not depend on the value of $z_i$
because of the mentioned condition.)
Therefore, the log probability-ratio of an increase in behavior compared to
staying constant that can be attributed to a difference of +1 in the
value of the predictor function $s^{0}_{ik}(x, z)$, is equal to
$\beta^{\rm beh}_k$. The probability ratio is $\exp(\beta^{\rm beh}_k)$.

For example, later in this section results are presented where,
for an analysis of drinking behavior, the
estimated parameter for average alter is 1.1414.
This means that when comparing two individuals who are equal in all respects
except that the friends of the first on average are  1 higher
on the drinking scale than those of the second individual,
the odds of increasing drinking behavior compared to no change
(in the event of a ministep with respect to drinking behavior)
are $\exp(1.1414) = 3.1$ times higher for the first individual
than for the second.
\medskip

The average similarity effect is defined by
\[ s^{\rm beh}_{i\vit}(x, z) = x_{i+}^{-1} \,
           \sum_j x_{ij} \big({\rm sim}^z_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^z}\big)
\]
(see Section~\ref{S_f_b}), where ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ is given in (\ref{simV})
in Section~\ref{S_internal}.
(If the ratio is 0/0, the effect is defined as 0.)
Subtracting $\widehat{{\rm sim}^z}$ is done just for the purpose
of centering.
Since the underlying measure ${\rm sim}^z_{ij}$ ranges from 0
(if $z_i$ and $z_j$ are the two different extreme values of $Z$)
to 1 (if $z_i = z_j$), this effect has a range of 1 independently
of the scaling of $Z$.
Therefore the average similarity effect, and also the total
similarity effect, differ from the total and average
alter effects by the fact that the latter are dependent on the scaling
of $Z$, whereas the former are not directly dependent on this scaling.
This means that parameters for average similarity effects can be regarded
as being on the same scale for different variables, but parameters
for average alter are not.
\medskip

The interpretations of total and average similarity are more laborious
to explain than the interpretation of the average alter effect.
This is because total and average similarity are not of the form
(\ref{beh_generic}). To explain the log-probabilities or probability ratios due to these
effects, it has to be understood how a change in the behavior $z_i$
will affect the values of these effects.
Examining their formulae leads to the following.

For a given actor $i$, the out-degree (number of friends) is denoted $x_{i+}$.
Let the number of friends whose values $z_j$ are less than, equal to,
or greater than the value $z_i $ of $i$, be denoted by $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Denote the range (maximum minus minimum value) of the behavior by $r$.
Then, in the event of a ministep with respect to behavior,
the contributions of the total similarity effect to the log-probabilities
of changes --1, 0, or +1, are given by $\beta^{\rm beh}_k(a-b-c)/r$,
0, and $\beta^{\rm beh}_k(c-a-b)/r$, respectively.
The contributions for the average similarity effect are
$\beta^{\rm beh}_k(a-b-c)/(rx_{i+})$,
0, and $\beta^{\rm beh}_k(c-a-b)/(rx_{i+})$.
This shows that the influence of the friends in the similarity effects
depends only on whether they have larger or smaller values than the focal actor,
not on how much larger the values are.
It also shows that for the similarity effects the dispersion of the
friends' values matters and not only their average,
whereas for the average alter effect only the average matters.

To have a compact formulation, without all this detail, one could
say the following. We use the example on one of the following
pages, where an average similarity effect on drinking is reported of
$\hat\beta^{\rm beh}_k = 3.9689$, where drinking has a range of $r = 5-1 = 4$.
For an individual all of whose friends drink more than this individual does,
the contribution of friends' influence to the probability ratio of an increase in drinking
as compared to no change is a factor $\exp(3.9689/4) = 2.7$.
(In this formulation, the condition `in the event of a ministep
with respect to drinking behavior" is left implicit.)

In the same situation, if hypothetically a total average similarity
effect were found of 0.82, then one could say that having \emph{one} additional
friend who drinks more than oneself increases the probability ratio of an increase in drinking
as compared to no change by a factor $\exp(0.82/4) = 1.23$.
In general, parameters for the total similarity effect will tend to be
smaller than those for the average similarity effect, because the former
refer to comparisons about a single friend, and the latter to comparisons
about all friends.

\subsection{Ego -- alter selection tables}

When some variable $V$ occurs in several effects in the model,
then its effects can best be understood
by considering all these effects simultaneously.
This section treats this issue for the case that $V$ is an
actor variable with more than two values (for dichotomous
variables the situation is simpler).

As an example, consider the
Glasgow data set from the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study of
West et al.\ \citep{MichellWest1996,PearsonWest03,SteglichEA10}.
We refer to any of these papers for a further description of the data.
The data is used for the 129 students who were present at all three measurement
times; this data set is available from the \SI website.
We treat friendship as the dependent network, drinking as the
dependent behaviour variable, and cannabis use (`drugs') as an
actor covariate.
Drinking has categories 1--5, coded as
1 (none), 2 (once or twice a year), 3 (once a month), 4 (once a week),
and 5 (more than once a week);
cannabis use is coded 1 (none), 2 (tried once), 3 (occasional) and 4 (regular).
The frequencies (over the three waves combined) of these substance
use variables are given in Figure~\ref{F_DD}.

For both actor variables, in the network part we use the
four-parameter specification of \citet{SL2019}, which is
a combination of the ego minus alter squared, alter squared,
ego, and alter effects.

The formulae in Section~\ref{S_f} imply that the
components in the network evaluation function corresponding to the effects
of variable $V$ are
\begin{equation}
\beta_{\rm sq.\ diff}  \sum_j x_{ij}\, (v_j - v_i)^2  \, + \,
 \beta_{\rm ego}\, (v_i - \bar v) \, x_{i+}
           \, + \, \beta_{\rm alter}  \sum_j x_{ij}\, (v_j - \bar v)
 \, + \, \beta_{\rm sq.\ alter}  \sum_j x_{ij}\, (v_j - \bar v)^2  \ .
          \label{eq_4par_V}
\end{equation}
The contribution to this formula of the single tie variable $x_{ij}$  ---
i.e., the difference between the values of~(\ref{eq_4par_V}) for $x_{ij}=1$
and $x_{ij}=0$  ---  is equal to
\begin{equation}
\beta_{\rm sq.\ diff}   (v_j - v_i)^2 \, + \,
  \beta_{\rm ego}\, (v_i - \bar v)
         \, + \, \beta_{\rm alter}\,  (v_j - \bar v) \, + \,
      \beta_{\rm sq.\ alter}  \, (v_j - \bar v)^2   \ .
                 \label{eq_4par}
\end{equation}

\iffalse
For example, if in a network dynamics model the
ego, alter, and similarity effects of a variable $V$ are specified,
then the formulae for their contribution
to the evaluation function can be obtained
from the components listed in Section~\ref{S_f} as
\begin{equation}
 \beta_{\rm ego}\, v_i \, x_{i+}
           \, + \, \beta_{\rm alter}  \sum_j x_{ij}\, v_j \, + \,
        \beta_{\rm sim}  \sum_j x_{ij}
                          ({\rm sim}^v_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v}) \ ,
        \label{eq_contr_V}
\end{equation}
where the similarity score is
\[
{\rm sim}^v_{ij}= 1 - \frac{\vert v_i - v_j \vert}{\Delta_V} \ ,
\]
with
$\Delta_V=\max_{ij}\vert v_i - v_j \vert$ being
the observed range of the covariate $v$
and where $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v}$ is the mean of all similarity scores.

The superscript $^{\rm net}$ is left out of the notation for the parameters
in order not to clutter the notation.

The contribution of variable $V$ to the
network evaluation function of actor $i$ is given by
\begin{align}
  &  \beta_{\rm ego}\, (v_i - \bar v)
                \, + \, \beta_{\rm alter}\,  (v_j - \bar v) \, + \,
   \beta_{\rm sim} \, ({\rm sim}^v_{ij} - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v} ) \nonumber \\
 & \hspace{3em} = \, \beta_{\rm ego}\, (v_i - \bar v)
              \, + \, \beta_{\rm alter}\,  (v_j - \bar v) \, + \,
        \beta_{\rm sim} \,  \Big( 1 - \frac{\vert v_i - v_j \vert}{\Delta_V}
                     - \widehat{{\rm sim}^v} \Big) \ .
                 \label{eq_sel}
\end{align}
\fi

It should be noted that by default all variables are internally centered by \si.
The mean values used for the centering
are given near the beginning of the file produced by
\sfn{print01Report} and are given by the \textsf{"mean"}
attributes of the covariates, as explained in
Section~\ref{S_center}.
This is made explicit in the formulae by the subtraction
of the mean $\bar v$.
From this equation (\ref{eq_4par}) a table, or a plot, can be made
that gives these contributions for some values of $v_i$ and $v_j$.

From the output of \sfn{print01Report} for these data it can be seen that
the alcohol use variable assumes values from 1 to 5, with overall
mean\footnote{The mean of the three means per wave.}
equal to $\bar v = 2.99$.
%, and mean of the similarity variable $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v} = 0.6983$.
Drug use is a changing actor variable, with
range 1--4, and mean $\bar v = 1.5$.
% and average dyadic similarity $\widehat{{\rm sim}^v} = 0.7533$.

Suppose that we fit a model of network-behavior co-evolution to this data set
with for the network evolution the effects of outdegree, reciprocity,
geometrically weighted edgewise shared partners (`gwesp', in the
\texttt{gwespFF} version, representing transitivity),
indegree popularity, outdegree activity, outdegree popularity,
and reciprocal degree activity; ego, alter, and same effect of sex;
for drinking and drug use the four effects in (\ref{eq_4par_V});
and for the  behavior (i.e., alcohol drinking) dynamics the
effects linear shape, quadratic shape (effect of drinking on itself),
and average alter.

The results obtained are as follows.\\

\noindent
We interpret here the parameter estimates for the effects of drinking behavior
and drug use without being concerned with the significance, or lack thereof.
For the drinking behavior, formula (\ref{eq_4par}) yields
\[
  -0.117\, (v_j - v_i)^2 \, + \,
  0.104 \, (v_i - \bar v)
         \, + \, 0.024 \,  (v_j - \bar v) \, - \,
      0.113  \, (v_j - \bar v)^2   \ .
\]

These values can be calculated for $v_i$ and $v_j$ ranging
from 1 to 5, with $\bar v = 2.99$.
This is called the \emph{selection table}.
On the \SI website the script \texttt{SelectionTables.r} is available,
which contains several functions that can be helpful for doing this.


Given that this script is available in the working directory,
the data set is called \texttt{G129\_Data}, the answer
(\sfn{sienaFit}) object is called \texttt{ans}, the network \texttt{"friendship"},
and the actor variable \texttt{"drinking"}, the following script
can be used.

\begin{verbatim}
source("SelectionTables.r") # needs to be done only once in the session
sm.drink <- selectionMatrix(ans, G129_Data, "friendship", "drinking", 1:5)
# It can be displayed
sm.drink
# and if package xtable is loaded, also be written
# to a latex or html file. For example,
tab.drink <- xtable(sm.drink)
print(tab.drink,file = "tab_drink.htm", type = "html",
             html.table.attributes = "rules = none")
# The html.table.attributes option gives the <table> tag
# used in the html file.
# and optional
xtable(sm.drink) # for a LaTeX table
\end{verbatim}

This will produce the following table.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Selection table for friendship with respect to drinking.}
\label{T_sel_fd}
\end{table}

It is instructive to make a plot of this table. This can be
done, e.g., using package \sfn{ggplot2} \citep{ggplot2}.
The following script will produce a \texttt{png} plot in the
current working directory.
Of course all elements of this script can be changed to accommodate the wishes
given the purpose of the figure.

\begin{verbatim}
library(ggplot2)
vname <- "drinking"
name <- "friendship"
levls <- 1:5
vselect <- selectionTable(ans, G129_Data, name, vname, levls)
sp <- ggplot(vselect, aes(valter, select, group = ego, colour = ego))
png(filename=paste("selectionTable_",vname,".png",sep = ""),
    width = 1000,height = 800)
sp + geom_point() + geom_smooth(size = 1.2, span = 3) +
        scale_colour_hue() +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = levls) +
        theme(legend.key = element_blank())+
        labs(x = paste(vname),
                y = paste("selection function"),
                title = paste("Effect",vname,"on",name),
                colour = paste(vname)) +
        theme_grey(base_size = 26, base_family = "") +
        theme(legend.key.width = unit(1, "cm")) +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
graphics.off()
\end{verbatim}

In this case, what was produced can be seen in Figure~\ref{F_sel_dk}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{selectionTable_drinking.png}
  \caption{Plot of selection table  for friendship with respect to drinking.}
  \label{F_sel_dk}
\end{figure}

From the table it can be concluded that there is a significant tendency
toward homophily (negative effect of ego minus alter squared).
\iffalse % to be added when SL2018 is out
Interpreting the results along the lines of  \citet{SL2018},
 there is a significant tendency
to homophily (negative effect of ego minus alter squared), and
a non-significant tendency to conformity (negative effect
of alter squared), where the estimated social norm is
$\bar v + \hat\beta_{\rm{altX}}/(2 \,  \hat\beta_{\rm{altSqX}}) =
2.99 + 0.024/(2 \times 0.113) = 3.1$.
\fi
We see that the maximum of the curves increases with
ego's value $v_i$, but for low $v_i$ the maximum is larger than $v_i$,
and for high $v_i$ it is less than $v_i$:
homophily is combined with a kind of `regression to the mean'.
\medskip

For drug use,  formula (\ref{eq_4par}) yields
\[
  -0.051\, (v_j - v_i)^2 \, + \,
  -0.123 \, (v_i - \bar v)
         \, - \, 0.137 \,  (v_j - \bar v) \, + \,
      0.164  \, (v_j - \bar v)^2   \ ,
\]
which leads to the following table.
\bigskip

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l }
  \hline
$ v_i \ \  \backslash  \ \ v_j $

  \hline
  1 &   0&16 & --0&02 &   0&03 & 0&30 \\
  2 & --0&02 & --0&09 &   0&06 & 0&43 \\
  3 & --0&30 & --0&27 & --0&01 & 0&47 \\
  4 & --0&68 & --0&54 & --0&19 & 0&39 \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Selection table for friendship with respect to drug use.}
\label{T_sel_fdg}
\end{table}


The corresponding figure is in Figure~\ref{F_sel_dg}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{selectionTable_drugs.png}
  \caption{Plot of selection table  for friendship with respect to drug use.}
  \label{F_sel_dg}
\end{figure}

Here we see a totally different pattern.
Since the sum of the alter squared and the difference squared effects
is positive, the parabolas have a minimum rather than a maximum.
Pay attention to the vertical scale: in Figure~\ref{F_sel_dk} the
difference between the highest and lowest values is about 2.5,
in Figure~\ref{F_sel_dg} it is about 1.2, half as much.
This signifies that overall, drug use has smaller effects on friendship
than smoking. For ego's who do not use cannabis ($v_i = 1$),
drug use of alters hardly matters;
egos who use cannabis regularly ($v_i = 4$) have a somewhat lower
attraction to alters with lower cannabis use.
For this actor variable, the specification with the effects of ego, alter,
and the product interaction ego $\times$ alter might fit just as well,
or perhaps better.

\clearpage

\subsection{Ego -- alter influence tables}

In quite a similar way as in the preceding section,
from the parameter estimates as presented in the
output tables, combined with the formulae for the effects,
we can construct tables indicating how likely are changes to
various different values of the behavior,
depending on the behavior of the actor's friends.
The functions used to define the effects can be found
in Section~\ref{S_f_b}, and it must not be forgotten that all variables
are internally centered in \rs, and the subtracted means are reported
in the initial output produced by \textsf{print01Report},
but for the covariates they also can be obtained by requesting the
`\textsf{mean}' attributes of the covariates, see Section~\ref{S_center}.

\subsubsection{Average alter}

In the model from the preceding section, the estimated coefficients in the
behavior evaluation function are as follows.

The dependent behavior variable now is indicated $Z$. (In the preceding
section the letter $V$ was used, but this referred to any actor variable
predicting network dynamics,
irrespective of whether it was also a dependent behavior variable.)

The formulae in Section \ref{S_f_b} show that the evaluation function
for this model specification is
\begin{equation}
   f^{\rm beh}_i \,=\, \beta_{\rm linear} \, (z_i - \bar z)
           \,+\, \beta_{\rm quad} \, (z_i - \bar z)^2 \,+\,
          \beta_{\rm avAlt}\,  (z_i - \bar z)(\bar z_{(i)} - \bar z)  \ ,
                    \label{eq_f_b2}
\end{equation}
where $\bar z_{(i)} $ is the average $Z$ value of $i$'s
friends,
\[
  \bar z_{(i)}  =\frac{1}{x_{i+}} \, \sum_j x_{ij}\, z_j   \ ,
\]
and 0 if this formula would be 0/0.

The \emph{Influence Table} presents a matrix with in the rows
the average of $Z$ for $i$'s friends,
in the columns the possible values of $z_i$,
and in the cells the evaluation function (\ref{eq_f_b2}).
For the table above, the evaluation function is
\[
   {\hat f}^{\rm beh}_i \,=\, 0.452 \, (z_i - \bar z)
           \,-\, 0.609 \, (z_i - \bar z)^2 \,+\,
         1.281\,  (z_i - \bar z)(\bar z_{(i)} - \bar z)  \ .
\]
At the \SI website there is a script \texttt{InfluenceTables.r}
which can be used to produce the table and the corresponding plot.

Given that this script is available in the working directory,
the data set is called \texttt{G129\_Data}, the answer
(\sfn{sienaFit}) object is called \texttt{ans}, the network `\texttt{friendship}',
and the actor variable `\texttt{drinking}', the following script
can be used.

\begin{verbatim}
source("InfluenceTables.r") # needs to be done only once in the session
im.drink <- influenceMatrix(ans, G129_Data, "friendship", "drinking", 1:5)
# It can be displayed
im.drink
# and if package xtable is loaded, also be written
# to a latex or html file. For example,
tbl.drink <- xtable(im.drink)
print(tbl.drink,file = "tbl_drink.htm", type = "html",
      html.table.attributes = "rules = none")
# The html.table.attributes option gives the <table> tag
# used in the html file.
# and optional
xtable(tbl.drink) # for a LaTeX table
\end{verbatim}

The influence table is as follows.

The interpretation\footnote{The interpretation is given here
in terms of attraction and preferences;
this is for the sake of having a straightforward and easy way of expressing
the interpretation, which strictly should be only about probabilities.}
is that each row corresponds to a given average behavior
of the focal actor's friends; comparing the different values in the row
shows the relative `attractiveness' of the different potential values
of ego's own behavior.
The maximum in each row is assumed at the diagonal. This means that
for each value for the average friends' behavior $\bar z_{(i)}$,
the focal actor `prefers' to have the same behavior as all these friends.
The differences in the bottom rows are larger than in the top rows,
indicating that in the case where the friends who do not drink at all,
the `preference' (or social pressure) toward imitating their behavior is
less strong than in the case where all the friends drink a lot.

A figure of this table can be produced, e.g., by the following script.
\begin{verbatim}
library(ggplot2)
name <- "drinking"
zname <- "friendship"
levls <- 1:5
png(filename = paste("influenceTable_", name, ".png",sep = ""),
					 width = 1000, height = 800)
zselect <- influenceTable(ans, G129_Data, zname, name, levls)
sp <- ggplot(zselect, aes(zego, select, group = alter, colour = alter))

   theme(legend.key.width = unit(1, "cm")) +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

The corresponding figure is in Figure~\ref{F_infl_dk}.

\end{figure}

\noindent
The five plotted curves intersect at the same point. This is indeed implied
by  formula (\ref{eq_f_b2}), which is 0 if $z_i = \bar z = 2.99$.


Another way to look at the behavior evaluation function is to consider
mathematically the location of its maximum.
This function here can be written also as
\[
   f^{\rm beh}_i \,=\, \big( 0.452 +
                1.281( \bar z_{(i)} - \bar z) \big) \, (z_i - \bar z)
       \,-\, 0.609 \, (z_i - \bar z)^2   \ .
\]
Differentiating with respect to $z_i$ shows that
this function is maximal for
\[
   z_i = \bar z \,+\, \frac{0.452 +
               1.281( \bar z_{(i)} - \bar z)}{2 \times  0.609 }
    \,=\,  0.22 \,+\, 1.05 \,  \bar z_{(i)}  \ ,
\]
just a little bit larger than $ \bar z_{(i)}$.
Indeed in the table and in the plot we see that, if $ \bar z_{(i)}$
has integer values 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,
the highest values are obtained exactly
for  $z_i = \bar z_{(i)}$.


\subsubsection{Average similarity}

The formulae in Section \ref{S_f_b} show that when average similarity is used
as the specification of social influence, the evaluation function is given by
\begin{equation}
   f^{\rm beh}_i(z_i) \,=\, \beta_{\rm trend} \, (z_i - \bar z)
               \,+\, \beta_{\rm drink} \, (z_i - \bar z)^2 \,+\,
                 \beta_{\rm av.\ sim}\,  \frac{1}{x_{i+}} \,
          \sum_j x_{ij} \big({\rm sim}(z_i, z_j) - \widehat{{\rm sim}^z}\big)
                    \label{eq_f_b10}
\end{equation}
where the similarity score is
\[
 {\rm sim}(z_i, z_j) \,=\, 1 \,-\, \frac{ \vert z_i - z_j \vert}{\Delta}
\]
in which $\Delta$ is the range (maximum minus minimum) of $Z$,
while $\widehat{{\rm sim}^z}$ is the mean of the similarity scores.
The latter is just a constant that does not have any influence on
the change probabilities of the behavior. Therefore we
use the equivalent form
\begin{equation}
   f^{\rm beh}_i(z_i) \,=\, \beta_{\rm trend} \, (z_i - \bar z)
               \,+\, \beta_{\rm drink} \, (z_i - \bar z)^2 \,+\,
                 \beta_{\rm av.\ sim}\,  \frac{1}{x_{i+}} \,
          \sum_j x_{ij} \bigg(
          \frac{ \vert \bar z - z_j \vert \,-\, \vert z_i - z_j \vert}{\Delta}
          \bigg) \ ,                    \label{eq_f_b1}
\end{equation}
which has the advantage that it is zero for $z_i = \bar z$,
and therefore comparable across $i$.

With this specification for the effect of drinking
(and a modified specification of the effect of drug use), the estimation
results are as follows.

Equation (\ref{eq_f_b1}) is less simple than equation (\ref{eq_f_b2}), because
(\ref{eq_f_b2}) is a quadratic function of $z_i$, with coefficients depending
on the $Z$ values of $i$'s friends as a function of their average,
whereas (\ref{eq_f_b1}) depends on the entire distribution
of the $Z$ values of $i$'s friends.

Suppose that, in model (\ref{eq_f_b1}),
the similarity coefficient $\beta_{\rm av.\ sim}$ is positive,
and compare two focal actors,
$i_1$  all of whose friends have $z_j = 3$
and $i_2$ who has four friends, two of whom with
$z_j = 2$ and the other two with $z_j = 4$.
Both actors are then drawn toward the preferred value
of 3; but the difference between drinking behavior 3 on one hand
and 2 and 4 on the other hand will be larger for $i_1$
than for $i_2$.
In model (\ref{eq_f_b2}), on the other hand,
since the average is the same,
both actors would be drawn equally strongly toward
the average value of~3.

Since the objective function for model (\ref{eq_f_b1}) depends
on all behavior values of the actor's friends, not just on their average,
here we present a table only for the special case of actors
all whose friends have the same behavior $z_{j}$.
For the parameters given above, the behavior
evaluation function then reads
\[
   f^{\rm beh}_i(z_i) \,=\, 0.461 \, (z_i - \bar z)
              \,-\, 0.003 \, (z_i - \bar z)^2 \,+\,
             6.190 \, \bigg(
          \frac{ \vert \bar z - z_j \vert \,-\, \vert z_i - z_j \vert}{\Delta}\bigg)  \ .
\]

The same script used above for average alter, \texttt{InfluenceTables.r},
will for this model specification produce the following table and plot.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l  r@{.}l }
 $z_j$ \ \ $ \backslash $ \ \ $z_i $   &  \mcc{2}{ 1}
               & \mcc{2}{ 2} & \mcc{2}{ 3} & \mcc{2}{ 4} &  \mcc{2}{ 5}
\separationb

  2 & --0&94 &   1&07 & --0&01 & --1&10 & --2&19 \\
  3 & --4&01 & --1&99 &   0&02 & --1&07 & --2&17 \\
  4 & --4&01 & --1&99 &   0&02 &   2&02 &   0&93 \\
  5 & --4&01 & --1&99 &   0&02 &   2&02 &   4&02 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The interpretation of this table is that each row corresponds to a
given common behavior
of the focal actor's friends; comparing the different values in the row
shows the relative `attractiveness' of the different potential values
of ego's own behavior.
The maximum in each row is assumed at the diagonal. This means that
for each value for the common friends' behavior $z_j$,
the focal actor prefers to have the same behavior as these friends.
The differences in the bottom rows are larger than in the top rows,
indicating that in the case where the friends who do not drink at all,
the preference (or social pressure) toward imitating their behavior is
less strong than in the case where all the friends drink a lot.


The values far away from the maximum contrast in this case less
strongly than in the case of the model with the average alter
effect, which is a consequence of the use of the absolute rather than
squared deviation.
However, neither of these models fits clearly better than the other.
The fact that the $t$-ratio for testing the social influence effect
is larger for average similarity (6.190/1.810 vs.\ 1.281/0.488)
suggest that this specification has a slightly better fit.

These tables present only the contribution of some of the terms of the
objective function, and the behavior dynamics will of course
be compounded if the objective function contains more effects.

Figure~\ref{F_infl_dk_avsim} gives the same information as the table.

\subsection{Effect sizes and measures of fit}

For linear regression models we are used to the coefficient of determination,
usually denoted $R^2$, defined as the proportion of variance
that is explained by the model.
Such a measure is not easily available for most other statistical models;
linear regression is special in allowing such a well-interpretable
measure of `fit'.
The following measures that have something of the same purpose
are available in \RS through function  \sfn{sienaRI}.

\subsubsection{Relative importance of effects}

The measure for \emph{relative importance of effects} in {\saom}s,
proposed by \citet{IndlekoferBrandes2013},
together with a measure for the (non-relative) \emph{importance of effects},
can be calculated by \sfn{sienaRI}.

Ministeps in the {\saom} are random events with $c$ possible outcomes;
for one-mode networks $c = n$, for two-mode networks $c$ is the
number of second-mode nodes +1 (for `no change'), for behavior
$c=3$ (changes by --1, 0, or +1); there may be constraints
diminishing the number of choices.
Let us denote the probabilities with which
actor $i$ in a ministep may change one of the outgoing ties by
$p_{i}(\beta, x) = \big(p_{i1}(\beta, x), \ldots, p_{ic}(\beta, x)\big)$.
The Indlekofer-Brandes measures are numerical answers to the question,
`How strongly do these probabilities depend on each of the effects?'.
In their paper, measures are proposed for expressing this per actor
per wave; these measures can be relative (so that the total importance
for each actor always is 1), or raw.
The relative importances are calculated by  \sfn{sienaRI} as \texttt{RIActors},
the raw importances as \texttt{IActors} (see the help page).
The  relative importances can be averaged over actors to give
\texttt{expectedRI}, which is printed by the print method for \sfn{sienaRI}.

\subsubsection{Entropy / relative certainty}

The uncertainty in a random categorical variable
can be measured by the \emph{entropy} \citep{Shannon1948}. For a probability
distribution with probabilities $p = (p_1, \ldots, p_c)$ for
an outcome with categories $1, \ldots, c$, it is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{entropy}
  H(p) \,=\, - \sum_{k=1}^c p_k {}\,^2 \log(p_k) \ .
\end{equation}
This is 0 if the variable is deterministic, i.e., one of the categories
has probability~1; the maximum value is ${}^2 \log(c)$, attained if all
categories have the same probability $1/c$ (maximum uncertainty).

Using a minus sign, the degree of certainty (as opposed to uncertainty)
in the outcome of the ministep with probabilities
$p_{i}(\beta, x) = \big(p_{i1}(\beta, x), \ldots, p_{in}(\beta, x)\big)$
can be expressed by
\begin{equation}\label{uncertainty}
  R_H(i,\beta, x) \,=\,  1 - \frac{H(p_{i}(\beta, x))}{{}^2 \log(n)} \ .
\end{equation}
For models with a constant rate function, this can be averaged over
actors to obtain a measure for a ministep taken by a random actor:
\begin{equation}\label{explained}
  R_H(\beta, x) \,=\, \frac1n \sum_i R_H(i,\beta, x) \ .
\end{equation}
This is a measure between 0 and 1.
It was proposed in \citet{Snijders04}, where further discussion may be found.

The values of the degree of certainty will generally be low, because
which tie to create or to drop normally will have a very large
degree of `chance variability'.
They are calculated by  \sfn{sienaRI} as \texttt{RHActors}
(see the help page). The mean over actors is printed by the print method
for \sfn{sienaRI}.

Note that the values given by \sfn{sienaRI} refer to each of the waves,
including the first wave; for this purpose, $x$ in (\ref{explained})
is taken as the observed network (and behaviour...) at each wave.


\subsubsection{Standard deviation of change statistics}

The  \emph{change statistics} $\delta_{ijk}(x)$
for an effect $s_{ik}(x)$ are the changes in the
value of this effect, for a given actor $i$, a given current state
of the network $x$, and a given alter $j$, when the
tie variable $x_{ij}$ would be toggled
(and analogous for behavioral dependent variables).
These are the basic `variables' in the conditional multinomial
logistic regression model that is at the heart of the \saom.
Their \emph{within-actor} standard deviations $\sigma_k(x)$
can be used to turn the parameters $\beta_k$ into
comparable quantities,
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_k(x) \, \beta_k  \ .   \label{standardized.beta}
\end{equation}
These express the parameters $\beta_k$, for different $k$ and a common $x$,
on a common scale.

These standard deviations are computed by \sfn{sienaRI} as \texttt{sigma}
and  printed by the print method for \sfn{sienaRI} if \texttt{printSigma = TRUE}.
The change statistics themselves are potentially a lot of numbers
($n^2 \times M \times K$, where $M$ is the number of waves and $K$
the number of effects in the model), and are only retained in the object
produced by \sfn{sienaRI} if \texttt{getChangeStats = TRUE};
see the help page for \sfn{sienaRI}.

\newpage
\section{Error messages}


This chapter contains some error messages with their explanations.
Currently it is not very  extensive; new error messages will be added
as answerable questions about them arise.
For understanding errors, general advice is to read in this manual,
read the help pages for functions, and look at the News page of the
Siena website.
\medskip

For diagnosing errors in R in general, a useful function is
\begin{verbatim}
traceback()
\end{verbatim}
This is to be called after an error was generated. It will give information,
usually very helpful, about where exactly the error was caused.
For example, it will give you the function generating the error message,
with recursive information.
\medskip

Note that it is not difficult to find the source of error messages in the code.
The easiest way is searching for the text of the error message
by some search machine such as google.
You will probably find it points to GitHub or another repository of the code.
There you can see what led to the error message, if you can understand some R.
An alternative, if you know the function generating the error message
(which you can find out by \texttt{traceback()}, see above)
is to search directly in the code for this function.
If the function is called, e.g., \textsf{siena07}, you can write
the code to a file called \texttt{listing.txt} by the commands
\begin{verbatim}
sink("listing.txt")
siena07
sink()
\end{verbatim}
Note that you should give the function name without parentheses.
When the function is not an exported function, e.g., \texttt{robmon},
you can request it via
\begin{verbatim}
sink("listing_robmon.txt")
RSiena:::robmon
sink()
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{After updating}

\noindent
Updates of \RS are not always completely backward
compatible. When updating the version, you may have to create
effects objects and algorithm objects again. If there is
incomplete backward compatibility with respect to
useability of scripts, this will be mentioned at the \emph{News page}
of the \SI website.

Creating a new effect object given that you have an earlier effect
object \texttt{old.effects} for an older \RS version can become
easier using the function \sfn{updateSpecification},
with commands such as the following.
\begin{verbatim}
eff0 <- getEffects(data_object)
new.effects <- updateSpecification(eff0, old.effects)
\end{verbatim}
See the help file for  \sfn{updateSpecification};
the \RS version used to create \texttt{old.effects} does not matter.



\subsection{During estimation}

$\diamondsuit$
\emph{Unlikely to terminate this epoch: more than 1000000 steps}.
\medskip

\begin{indentation}{0.04\textwidth}{0pt}
\noindent
This can happen in function \textsf{siena07};
in conditional estimation (\texttt{cond = FALSE} in\\
 \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}),
when the rate parameter provisionally has hit a value such that the
desired number of changes will probably never be reached;
or in non-conditional estimation when the number of ministeps has become
too large before arriving at the time for the next wave.
See Section~\ref{S_cond}.

\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Potential solutions.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Check whether your model specification is reasonable;
    for example, there might be doubts about the specification of the
    rate function.
\item  Use non-conditional estimation (Section~\ref{S_cond}) if you were not
   already doing so.
\item If the model includes the \texttt{outRate} effect, consider
    replacing it by the \texttt{outRateLog} effect;
    but note that this works properly only for non-conditional estimation
    (\texttt{cond = FALSE} in \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate}).
\item If you are working with a data set with more than two waves, there might
   be unmodeled heterogeneity between the periods. Try modeling the periods
   separately.
\item Set the parameter \texttt{firstg} in \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate} to a
   lower value than the default 0.2.
   This will make the algorithm move more slowly, hopefully avoiding the problematic region
   in the parameter space.

   The advice would be to set  \texttt{firstg}  to 0.02
   and expect the necessity to do a second estimation using the \texttt{prevAns}
   parameter in \textsf{siena07}. If the problem still occurs for \texttt{firstg} = 0.02,
   use a smaller value (but less than 0.001 probably makes no sense).
   \texttt{firstg} determines the step sizes in the stochastic approximation
   algorithm; it is mentioned in some places earlier in this manual.
   Especially for models with additional rate effects the default value of 0.2
   might be too large.
    \texttt{firstg}  is the initial value of parameter $a_N$ mentioned
    on p.\ 393 of \citet{Snijders01}.
\item Use multiple processes (\texttt{useCluster = TRUE, nbrNodes = ...}).
\item In combination with trying out a lower value for \texttt{firstg},
    you might try setting a higher value for  \texttt{doubleAveraging}
    in \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}. Double averaging is a different definition
    of the Robbins-Monro update step; see Section~\ref{S_contconv}.
    You could try setting  \texttt{doubleAveraging} to 1 or 2, which uses
    single averaging in the first 1 or 2 subphases; or you could set it to
    4, avoiding double averaging altogether (if you have 4 subphases).

The calculation of probabilities for the next ministep failed,

given the current state of the model.

This may have to do with structurally determined values
(see Section~\ref{S_struct})
and/or with joiners and leavers (see Section~\ref{S_comp});
or with a restriction that a variable (tie variable, behavioral variable)
is monotonic (Section~\ref{S_monotone}), i.e., can only
increase or only decrease.

Perhaps the most likely possibility is that you are working with a
multiple group data set (perhaps using \textsf{sienaBayes})
for which some groups are only-increasing or only-decreasing,
which then is taken by \RS to apply also to the simulations carried
out for this group, as mentioned in Section~\ref{S_monotone}.
\smallskip

\noindent
\emph{Solution.} \\
Try to find out why it is possible in your data set
that some actor has no options at all to choose from.

as recommended in Section~\ref{S_monotone}; also see the help file for
\textsf{sienaDependent}.

Note that if you wish to forbid some actors from making any changes
in some dependent variable, you can use a rate function dependent
on a dummy actor covariate (effect \texttt{rateX}), with parameter fixed
to a large negative value such as --100, which is sufficiently close to
infinity (recall the exponentation in the calculation of the rate function)
to effectively prevent this actor from taking any ministeps.

This can happen as the result of a score test requested in function

If this error message occurs for \textsf{sienaTimeTest}, it indicates
linear dependencies in the list of effects estimated

\section{For programmers: Get the source code}

To do something with the source code,
first you must get access to it.
In the first place, it is good to know that for any \R function
that can be called,
the source code is listed by writing the function name.
Thus, e.g., if \RS is loaded, the command
\begin{verbatim}
sienaAlgorithmCreate
\end{verbatim}
will list the code for the function with this name.

To get insight into a package, and certainly to modify
or personalize it, it is necessary, however,
to get the source code of the whole package.
This is available from GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena/}.

\iffalse

In the file structure for \texttt{RSienaTest} there is a directory
\texttt{doc} which contains a lot of programmers' documentation.
These are in the form of \LaTeX \ files, which can be compiled
to produce .pdf files.
The file \texttt{Siena\_Algorithms.tex} contains a lot of details
about algorithms used.
For code developers, important files are
\texttt{HowToCommit.tex} and \texttt{RSienaDeveloper.tex}.
The latter file will guide you to the further documentation.
\fi

A lot of programmers' documentation is also in the file
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}
which can be downloaded from the
\SI website.

\section{For programmers: Other tools you need}
\begin{description}
\item[Windows]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download and install the appropriate (version number
  depending on which \R you are using)
\textsf{Rtools.exe} from
  \url{http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/}.
  (I think this is not the right place any more - should be downloaded from CRAN.)
\item Make sure you check the box to amend your path during installation.
\item Beware: if you later install
  other programs containing utilities such as tar (delphi is one offender),
  you may need to uninstall and reinstall Rtools, as you need Rtools
  at the start of your path.
\item Add the path-to-the file
 R.exe to your path. Right-click on My Computer icon,
  select Properties/Advanced/Environment variables\ldots   \\
 Restart your computer to put the new path into effect.
\end{enumerate}
\item[Mac]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure the Xcode tools are installed.
\item Add the path-to-the-file R.exe to your path.
\end{enumerate}
\item[linux]
 Add the path-to-the-file R.exe to your path.
\end{description}

\section{For programmers: Building, installing and checking the package}
In a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to the directory
immediately above the
siena source tree. Here we assume the source tree is in a directory
called \sfn{RSiena}. (You may have minor
difficulties if it is not the same as the name of the package you are trying to
build or install.)

For Windows computers, the following `type' instructions are Dos commands.
A convenient way to apply them are by including them in a batch
file (extension name \texttt{.bat}) followed by a name with \verb|pause|
so that the Dos window -- that will contain the error messages
if there are any -- will still be there when all is over.

\begin{description}
\item[Install] Installing will recreate the binary and install in your normal R
  library path. Type\\
\verb|R CMD INSTALL RSiena|
\item[Build] Building will create a tar ball. Type\\
\verb|R CMD build RSiena|\\
This may give warning messages about the line endings if you run it on
Windows. Do not worry, unless you have created any new source files, when it
might remind you to set the property of \textsf{eol-style} on them when you add
them to the repository.
\item [Check] Checking is a process designed to ensure that packages are likely
  to work correctly when installed. Type\\
\verb|R CMD check RSiena_1.4.7.tar.gz|\\
(where the version number is adjusted to match the tar ball name.)
\item[zip file] To make a zip file that can be used in Windows for
`installing from a local zip file', and therefore is easy for distribution
to others, type\\
\verb|R CMD INSTALL --build RSiena_1.4.7.tar.gz| \\
(where again the version number is adjusted to match the tar ball name.)
\end{description}

If you make a change you need to \textsf{INSTALL} the new version in order to
test it, and before you commit any changes to a repository you should
\textsf{check} your new version. Make sure you get \emph{no} warnings or
errors from the check.

You can also \textsf{INSTALL} from a tar ball, and \textsf{check} a source
tree.

If you have permission problems on Linux or Mac, you may need to do the first
install from within \textsf{R}, so that the necessary personal library
directories will be created. Use\\
\verb|install.packages(tarballname, repos = NULL)| \\after creating a tar
ball. (Or possibly just try to install some other package within R which will
create the directories for you.)

You can unpack a tar ball by using

\verb|tar xf tar-ball-name|

\section{For programmers: Understanding and adding an effect}

If you wish to check the definition of an effect,
you can locate it in the source code and study it.
You may also add
effects to your personalized version of \rs.
If you think the effect could be useful for others, too,
it will be appreciated if you propose it for inclusion through
one of the discussion lists or directly to the maintainer
of the package.
This section gives the outline of the procedure for adding an effect, and then presents
an elaborate example.

If you only wish to understand an effect without creating
a new one, then you may
follow the appropriate steps of this section.
The main things then are to go to the \textsf{Effectfactory.cpp}
file, find the name of the effect you are interested in and
from there the function that implements it
and read the code of this function.

The explanations here are not yet given for generic effects, which allow
a more streamlined construction of effects. Looking at the code,
starting with the file \sfn{EffectFactory.cpp}, may be helpful for understanding
this construction of generic effects.
For example, compare the construction of \texttt{sameXTransTrip} to that of
\texttt{sameXInPop}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Work out the definition of the effect and the contribution or
      change statistic.
      For network effects, the change statistic is
      \begin{equation}
      \Delta_{kij} (x) =  s_{ki}(x^{+ij}) -     s_{ki}(x^{-ij})  \label{changestat}
      \end{equation}
      where $x^{+ij}$ is the network with the tie $i \rightarrow j$
      and $x^{-ij}$ is the network without this tie.
\item The list of all defined effects can be obtained from \textsf{effectsDocumentation},
      which produces a file \textsf{effects.html} or \textsf{effects.pdf}.
      All effects are also listed, with their definitions, in the manual (Section~\ref{S_math}). \\
      Determine an existing effect that is most similar
      to this effect (or perhaps more than one).
      In the file \textsf{effects.html} or \textsf{effects.pdf} the effects are grouped
      by \sfn{effectGroup}.
\item Open the file \textsf{allEffects.csv} located in
       \textsf{"RSiena\textbackslash data"}. The default program for opening a .csv file
       usually is Excel, but other editors may be more helpful
       for opening this particular file; e.g., NotePad or NotePad++.
       It must \underline{not} be saved as a Excel file!
	   \begin{itemize}
		\item You will see that the first column is called \sfn{effectGroup}.
              These groups define combinations of dependent variable, effect type,
              and covariates (if any)
              (e.g. nonSymmetricObjective,  bipartiteSymmetricObjective).
              Identify the effectGroup where this effect belongs.
              Determine which is which by considering some examples
              in this file or in the result of \sfn{effectsDocumentation()}.

              For covariate-related effects for two-mode networks, see
              extra remarks in Section~\ref{S_notestwomode}.
    	\item Insert a new row in this group.
              Copy a row that corresponds best to your new effect
              and modify effectName, functionName, shortName,
              and more if this seems necessary.
              Perhaps your new effect is suitable in more than one group;
              then a new row can be made for all these groups, differing only
              in the name of the effect group; e.g., check that there are
              three versions of \texttt{inPop}, for directed, non-directed,
              and bipartite (two-mode) networks.
              Assume our new effect has shortName \textit{newEf}.

              In some cases, the new function will have extra parameters,
              as you can see from other examples;
              this is mostly the case, if one function is being used to define
              more than one effect.

              For how to deal with internal effect parameters, look up
              a function defining an effect that has such
              a parameter.

		\item Build the package and install it.  Check from R that
              the new effect (which has only been created nominally)
              appears now in the effects object in RSiena.\\
              If this is not the case, there may be further changes necessary
              in the file \sfn{effects.r}; also see
              Section~\ref{S_notestwomode}.
		\end{itemize}
\item Open the folder
      \textsf{"RSiena\textbackslash src\textbackslash
         model\textbackslash effects"}.
         In an editor open the files \textsf{AllEffects.h}
         and  \textsf{EffectFactory.cpp}.\\
         These are C++ files; using a C++ editor is convenient
         but not necessary. Note however that you must save the files
         as ASCII (raw text) files without changing their names.
        Let us use the name \textit{NewEffect} as the function name
        to be used (replace this by whatever is appropriate).
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In the file AllEffects.h you need to add the line\\
                \texttt{ \#include "NewEffect.h" }\\
                 where it is alphabetically appropriate.
            \item In the file \textsf{EffectFactory.cpp}, at the appropriate place,
                  add the lines
                \begin{verbatim}
    else if (effectName == "newEf")
	{
		pEffect = new NewEffect(pEffectInfo);
	}
                \end{verbatim}
			\item Now you will need to create two files (namely header
                  and source files for
                   C++) that should be called \textsf{NewEffect.h} and
                   \textsf{NewEffect.cpp}.
                   If there is a similar effect to the one you want to add
                   it is usually easier to use it as a template.

                  We recommend opening any effect file to see
                  how the syntax works, but creating a new effect will be hard
                   without knowing at least a bit of C++.
            \item Add the name \textsf{NewEffect.cpp} to the file \textsf{sources.list}.
                  This is a long file without any hard returns.
                  Separation of filenames is by blanks.
                  It does not matter where you put it .
		\end{itemize}

		\item Once you are done editing you should build
the package again and install it (from the command prompt)
and then go to R to see if it is available to you.

It is a good idea to check the target statistics computed for a simple
two-wave data set such as \sfn{s50}.
Examples are in the script
\url{https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena/blob/main/checkEffects.R}.
\end{enumerate}

As examples, start with simple effects.
For example, a network effect depending on a nonlinear transformation
of outdegree, or a behavior effect depending nonlinearly
on the behavior and nothing else.
After having obtained experience with such a simple effect,
continue with the effect that you are interested in.
\medskip

If you want to use the effect in interactions, consult the section in
\href{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/Siena_algorithms.pdf}{\texttt{Siena\_algorithms.pdf}}
about interaction effects.
If you wish to construct a dyadic or ego effect, note that
you should define a \sfn{tieStatistic}
rather than an \sfn{egoStatistic}.
\medskip

Note that if your new effect could usefully be used as part of a multiple
network effect you should use the generic effect approach and not the following.


\subsection{Example: adding the truncated out-degree effect}

As an example, we show how the truncated out-degree effect
(short name \texttt{outTrunc}) was added. It is
 defined by
 \begin{equation}
  s^{\rm net}_{i}(x) = \text{min}(x_{i+}\,,\, p)   \label{outTrunc}
 \end{equation}
where $p$ is an \hyperlink{T_effpar}{internal effect parameter}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The change statistic (\ref{changestat}) is
      \begin{equation}
       \Delta_{ij}(x) \,=\, \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                   1 & \text{  if } \{x_{i+} < p,  x_{ij} = 0 \}
                     \text{ or } \{x_{i+} \leq p,  x_{ij} = 1 \} \\
                   0 & \text{  else. }
                   \end{array}         \right.  \label{outTrunc_cs}
      \end{equation}
      Note that for this effect the case for going up ($x_{ij} = 0$)
      must be distinguished from the case
      for going down ($x_{ij} = 1$).
\item In the file \textsf{allEffects.csv} the name of the
      effect group \textsf{nonSymmetricObjective} seems to cover the
      type of effect we are considering, and also contains other effects
      such as out-degree activity which are very similar to this
      effect.\\
      The row for the out-degree activity (sqrt) effect was copied
      and inserted below this row. The `effectName' was changed to
      \texttt{outdegree-trunc(\#)}, the `functionName' to
      \texttt{Sum of outdegrees trunc(\#)},
      and the `shortname" to \texttt{outTrunc}.
      The hash sign (\texttt{\#}) in these names will be replaced
      by the value of the
      internal effect parameter in the written output.
      The `parm' column, which defines
      the default value of the internal effect parameter, was set to 5.
      \\
      The package was built. Loading it in \R and creating an
      \RS data set showed that indeed the effect was there.
\item The name \sfn{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect} was chosen for the new function.\\
      In the file \textsf{AllEffects.h} the line
      \begin{verbatim}
    #include `TruncatedOutdegreeEffect.h'
      \end{verbatim}
      was included at the appropriate alphabetic place.

      In the file \textsf{EffectFactory.cpp}, after the piece referring
      to \texttt{effectName == "outActSqrt"}, the lines
\begin{verbatim}
    else if (effectName == "outTrunc")
    {
         pEffect = new TruncatedOutdegreeEffect(pEffectInfo);
    }
\end{verbatim}
      were inserted.  This refers the program, when it encounters short name
      \sfn{outTrunc}, to the function \sfn{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect}.  The next
      step was to construct this function.
\item To choose a template for \sfn{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect},
      we could make various
      different choices; here it is important to have a look at the various
      effects defined in Chapter~\ref{S_math} that depend only on the
      outdegree. Consider the effects Outdegree activity - sqrt
      (short name \texttt{outActSqrt})
      and sum of (1/(out-degree + $p$) (short name \texttt{outInv})
      as possible examples.
      A look in  \textsf{EffectFactory.cpp} shows that these are implemented
      using the functions
      \textsf{OutdegreeActivitySqrtEffect}
      and \textsf{InverseOutdegreeEffect}, respectively.
      Therefore look at the files \textsf{OutdegreeActivitySqrtEffect.cpp}
      and \textsf{InverseOutdegreeEffect.cpp} where these functions
      are defined.\\
      The former defines the effect through a
      `\sfn{calculateContribution}' function, which defines the
      tie flip contribution
      (the function called $\Delta_{ij}(x)$ above)
      and \sfn{tieStatistic}, which is the function $r_{ij}(x)$
      when the effect can be defined as
      \begin{equation}
       s^{\rm net}_{i}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}\,r_{ij}(x) \ .  \label{tiestat}
      \end{equation}
      The latter defines the effect through  a
      \sfn{calculateContribution} function and an\\
      \sfn{egoStatistic} function, which is the effect
      as defined in (\ref{outTrunc}). It should be noted that
      generally effects can be defined either by the one or the other
      combination.


      Since our new effect cannot be expressed in a straightforward way
      by an equation of the type (\ref{tiestat}), we chose to use
      the files \textsf{InverseOutdegreeEffect.h} and\\
      \textsf{InverseOutdegreeEffect.cpp} as templates.
      This has a second advantage: the  \texttt{outInv} effect has an
      \hyperlink{T_effpar}{effect parameter}, which we also need
      to represent the parameter $p$ in  (\ref{outTrunc}).

      As a first step,   the files \textsf{InverseOutdegreeEffect.h} and
      \textsf{InverseOutdegreeEffect.cpp} were saved under the new names
      \textsf{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect.h} and
      \textsf{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect.cpp}.
      \\
      For the header file \textsf{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect.h}, all strings
      `inverseoutdegreeeffect'
      were changed into `truncatedoutdegreeeffect' while retaining the original
      use of upper and lower case.
      The explanation also was adapted.
      The header file now implies that for the function
      \texttt{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect}
      functions are needed of the types \sfn{calculateContribution},\\
      \sfn{endowmentStatistic} and \sfn{egoStatistic}.
      \\
      This was implemented in the file \textsf{TruncatedOutdegreeEffect.cpp},
      which just was created by renaming \textsf{InverseOutdegreeEffect.cpp}.
      First  all strings `outdegreeactivitysqrteffect'
      were changed into `truncatedoutdegreeeffect', again retaining the original
      use of upper and lower case.\\
      To understand the C++ syntax, keep into account
      the object-oriented nature of C++.
      The keyword \sfn{this} is a pointer referring to the object
      in which the current function is defined, and the arrow \texttt{->}
      indicates a further pointer; thus, the variable\\
      \texttt{this->pNetwork()->outDegree(this->ego())}\\
      refers to the outdegree of ego (denoted in our mathematical
      formulae by $i$) in the current network -- in other words,
      $x_{i+}$.\\
      The variable \texttt{this->lc} refers to the
      internal effect parameter, denoted in our formulae by $p$.
      The \sfn{return} statement defines the function value that is returned
      when the function is called.
      \\
      Armed with this knowledge, we specified the change statistic,
      implementing (\ref{outTrunc_cs}), as follows.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
double TruncatedOutdegreeEffect::calculateContribution(int alter) const
{
    double change = 0;

    // Current out-degree
    int d =	this->pNetwork()->outDegree(this->ego());
    if (this->outTieExists(alter))
    {
        // After a tie withdrawal, the new out-degree would be d-1, and
        // the new effect value would have decreased by 1 if d <= this->lc

        if (d <= this->lc)
        {
             change = 1;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // When introducing a new tie, the new out-degree would be d+1, and
        // the new effect value would have increased by 1 if d < this->lc

        if (d < this->lc)
        {
             change = 1;
        }
    }

    return change;
}
\end{verbatim}
}

      The effect statistic, implementing (\ref{outTrunc_cs}),
      was specified as follows.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
double TruncatedOutdegreeEffect::egoStatistic(int ego,
    const Network * pNetwork)
{
    // Current out-degree
    int d =	this->pNetwork()->outDegree(this->ego());

    if (d <= this->lc)
    {
         return d;
    }
    else
    {
         return this->lc;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\item To the file \textsf{src{\textbackslash}sources.list}, the item
      \texttt{model/effects/TruncatedOutdegreeEffect.cpp} was added.
\item Having done this, the package was built and installed again.
      (To be honest, there first were some errors; but the error messages
       from the compiler are quite clear and easily led to solving
       the errors.)\\
      Upon starting \R and loading \rs, indeed the new effect  was
      available. For an easy check, the following commands
      were used.
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
mynet       <- sienaDependent(array(c(s501, s502), dim = c(50, 50, 2)))
mydata      <- sienaDataCreate(mynet)
myalgorithm <- sienaAlgorithmCreate(projname = "s50_12")
myeff       <- getEffects(mydata)
myeff       <- setEffect(myeff, outTrunc, parameter = 3)
ans         <- siena07(myalgorithm, data = mydata, effects = myeff)
summary(ans)
\end{verbatim}
}
      The parameter was set at 3, because the maxima of the
      observed out-degrees
      in the two data sets \sfn{s501} as well as \sfn{502} were 5,
      so the `outdegree-trunc(\#)' effect would be highly collinear with the
      outdegree effect if the default parameter of 5 were used.
      This led to good convergence. To check the calculation of the
      statistics, it was noted that the output file
      mentioned the target values
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
Observed values of target statistics are
  1. Number of ties                                           116.0000
  2. Number of reciprocated ties                               70.0000
  3. Sum of outdegrees trunc(3)                               105.0000
\end{verbatim}
}
      The value of the target statistic for the new effect should be
      \[
       \sum_i s^{\rm net}_{i}(x(t_2)) \,=\,
                         \sum_i \text{min}(x_{i+}(t_2), 3) \ .
      \]
      This can be directly calculated in \R by requesting
\begin{verbatim}
sum(pmin(rowSums(s502),3))
\end{verbatim}
      which indeed returns the value 105, confirming that the calculation
      of the ego statistic seems correct.
\item To complete the extension of the package by this effect,
      it also was added to the set of effects for symmetric
      and bipartite networks.
      This was done by inserting, at appropriate places in the file
      \sfn{allEffects.csv},
      the same line but now with \sfn{effectGroup}
      changed to \sfn{bipartiteObjective} and \sfn{symmetricObjective},
      respectively.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Notes on effectGroups and two-mode networks}
\label{S_notestwomode}

For two-mode networks the difference between the two node sets implies
some peculiarities.
Recall that effectGroups are used in the file \texttt{allEffects.csv}
and in function \sfn{effects.r}.

In the function \textsf{getEffects} in file \sfn{effects.r}, some additional
measures are taken for effects in effectGroup \sfn{covarBipartiteEff}.
This implies that for adding such effects, it will be necessary to see whether
this function also must be modified; this will have to be done
in function \sfn{covarBipartiteEff}.
(Note: it would be preferable perhaps to have separate effect classes
for covariates on the first and on the second mode, as done for the effect
groups in the following paragraphs.)

A different approach was taken for effectGroups
\sfn{covarABehaviorBipartiteObjective} and \sfn{covarBBehaviorBipartiteObjective}:
the former is for covariates on the first node set, the second for
covariates on the second node set.

For effects defined for two dependent networks and one actor covariate,
the following effectGroups are defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item \sfn{covarNetNetObjective} is for effects where the second network is one-mode;
\item \sfn{covarABNetNetObjective} is without restriction on the modes;
\item \sfn{covarANetNetObjective}  is for effects where, if the second network is two-mode,
     the covariate is defined for the first node set;
\item \sfn{covarBNetNetObjective} is for effects where, if the second network is two-mode,
     the covariate is defined for the second node set.
\end{itemize}
\medskip

For effects defined for a two-mode dependent network, another dependent
network (in the role of explanatory; whether one- or two-mode), and one actor covariate,
the following effectGroup is defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item \sfn{covarABipNetObjective} for covariates defined for the first node set.
\end{itemize}
\medskip

Further some of the complex effectGroups are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \sfn{nonSymmetricNonSymmetricObjective} is for combination of two
    directed networks, one in the role of dependent network and the other
    in the role of explanatory network;
\item \sfn{nonSymmetricSymmetricObjective} is for the combination of a
    directed network in the role of dependent network and a non-directed network
    in the role of explanatory network;
\item \sfn{nonSymmetricSymmetricSObjective} is for the combination of a
    directed network in the role of dependent network and a non-directed network
    in the role of explanatory network, where also the primary setting
    can have the role of explanatory network (and is treated with cross-lagged
    statistics as usual for co-evolution models);
\item \sfn{tripleNetworkObjective} is for combinations
    of three networks where for the two in the role of explanatory networks,
\item \sfn{bipartiteNonSymmetricObjective} is for combination of
    a two-mode dependent network and a directed network
    in the role of explanatory network;
\item \sfn{bipartiteSymmetricObjective} is for combination of
    a two-mode dependent network and a non-directed network
    in the role of explanatory network;
\item \sfn{bipartiteBipartiteObjective} is for combination of two
    two-mode networks, one in the role of dependent network and the other
    in the role of explanatory network;
\item \sfn{dyadANetNetObjective} is for combinations
    of two networks and a dyadic covariate, where the network in the role
    of dependent network should be one-mode, and the dyadic covariate
    should be on the node set (`squared') of the dependent network;
\item \sfn{behaviorOneOneModeObjective} is for dependent behavioral variables and
    two explanatory one-mode directed networks;
\item \sfn{behaviorSymSymObjective} is for dependent behavioral variables and
    two explanatory one-mode non-directed networks;
\item \sfn{behaviorOneModeSymObjective} is for dependent behavioral variables and
    two explanatory one-mode networks, the first directed, the second non-directed.
\item \sfn{behaviorBipBipObjective} is for dependent behavioral variables and
    two explanatory two-mode networks with identical actor sets;
\item \sfn{dyadBehaviorNetObjective} is for dependent behavioral variables,
   an explanatory one-mode network and an explanatory dyadic covariate.
\end{itemize}

If you wish to add an effect with a combination of variables that is not yet implemented,
you have also to treat it in \sfn{effects.r} (which will require some figuring out) and
mention it in \sfn{effectsDocumentation.r}.

\section{Appendix: List of Functions in Order of Execution}

    This appendix
    provides a description of the functions that constitute the
    \RS package. This is intended as a quick reference or catalogue for the
    user to employ Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SAOM) to analyze network
    dynamics in \Rn.

    The functions are presented in execution order (more or less as
    they would be used in practice). A list of useful \R
    functions to read and prepare the data set is also included at the
    beginning. In all cases examples on how to use these functions are provided.
    In the `syntax' column,
    when arguments of functions are followed by = and a single option,
    this is the default option.

    The descriptions provided are suitable for beginner and intermediate \R and
    Siena users. For the advanced specifications of the functions the user
    should refer to the help by typing `?funName' in the \R console, where
    `funName' is the name of the function.

    We consider that the model estimation is composed by 6 stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Getting started
    \item Get the data the right format or check that it is in the correct
      format
    \item Data specification
    \item Model specification
    \item   Model estimation
    \item   Working with the results
\end{enumerate}

Tables \ref{tab:FuncExR} and \ref{tab:ListSienaExec} present the list of useful
\R functions and the list of \RS functions in execution order, respectively.

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item Improvements of functionality:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item New parameter \texttt{targets}  in \sfn{siena07} , used to supersede the targets
    calculated from the data (not for use in estimation for regular data sets,
    see the help file for \sfn{siena07}).
  \item \sfn{effectsDocumentation()}  reports to the console
    the name of the file that was written.
  \item \sfn{sienaDataCreate}  stops with an error message if there is a bipartite
    network before a one-mode network.
  \item If the data contains a continuous dependent behavioral variable and
    the algorithm specifies conditional estimation, the estimation stops
    with a clear error message.
    \end{itemize}
\item Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Various corrections in the \texttt{cpp} code.
  \item Allow \sfn{sienaDataCreate}  to work with a single variable defined as

    on continuous behavior dependent variables.
  \item Changed the check for constant dyadic covariates for
  sparse matrices (GitHub issue \#88).
  \item Some of the recently added effect groups were missing from
    \sfn{effectsDocumentation}. This led to an incomplete listing of the effects.
    They are now included.
  \end{itemize}
\item Dropped functionality:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item \sfn{sienaRI}  temporarily disabled because of a memory leak.
  \item The option \texttt{prML=2}  temporarily disabled because of a memory leak in the
    \texttt{move}  proposal distribution (\sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate}).
  \end{itemize}
\item Other changes:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item List of changes in the code before 2022, but since the source
  code was hosted at GitHub (i.e., since September, 2020) moved from

\item 2023-08-01 GitHub, package version 1.3.24

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item Corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item In \sfn{getEffects}, the effects object was given an attribute
     \texttt{version} (was not correct in version 1.3.23).\\
    (This led in that version to always giving a warning if any interaction
    effects were specified.)
  \item Corrections of implementation of acceptance by \sfn{sienaGOF} of a list of
    \sfn{sienaFit} objects (was not correct in version 1.3.23).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item 2023-06-29 GitHub, package version 1.3.23.


Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item New effects:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item New effects \texttt{diffWXClosure}, \texttt{sameWWClosure},  \texttt{diffWWClosure},
    \texttt{diffXWClosure}, \texttt{sameXWClosure}, \texttt{unequalX}.
  \item \texttt{JoutMix} made available for bipartite dependent networks.
  \item For continuous behavior variables depending on a bipartite dependent
    network, the effect group \sfn{continuousBipartiteObjective} was created,
    with effects \texttt{outdeg}, \texttt{outdegSqrt}, and \texttt{isolateOut}.
  \item \texttt{sameXOutAct} and \texttt{diffXOutAct} now have a
  parameter 2 for $\sqrt{}$\ .

  \item The model for continuous behavior variables seems to work now.
   \item \sfn{sienaGOF} now also accepts a list of \sfn{sienaFit} objects.
  \item In \sfn{sienaDataCreate}, the warning message that there is at least one
    "upOnly" period now is made for each dependent
    variable instead of only the last.
  \item A warning is given if the used version of the effects object
    is not current and it contains interaction effects
    (then it is possible that the interacting effects are chosen incorrectly,
    even though the \texttt{effectName} of the interaction seems OK).
   \item Various coding improvements and better texts of
   warnings and error messages.
  \item In the violin plot for \sfn{sienaGOF}, the default bandwidth selection
     method is used  (the use of "nrd" sometimes led to absent plots
     because of negative bandwidth).
    \end{itemize}
\item  Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item The error was corrected that occurred if \texttt{useStdInits = TRUE} in
   \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} and the effects object includes interaction effects.

     see Section~\ref{S_modeltype_dir}.
    \end{itemize}
\item  Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item Coding of some ``generic effects'' was cleaned up and corrected.
   This led to changes in coding of several distance-2 covariate-related network
	 effects such as \texttt{altDist2}, \texttt{totDist2} and \texttt{altInDist2};
   some of these \underline{may} have been incorrect in earlier versions.
  \item In \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate}, changed default \texttt{prML=2} back to \texttt{prML=1};
    stop if Maximum Likelihood estimation is attempted for a data set
    containing more than one dependent variable
    with \texttt{prML=2}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
\item Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item \sfn{updateSpecification} (in \texttt{effectsMethods}) now also updates
    internal parameter values.
  \item In \sfn{TriadCensus}, the empty network will not lead to an error
    but be reported with the correct triad census.
  \item For \texttt{reciAct}, check whether internal parameter is equal to 2
    replaced by check whether
    absolute difference from 2 is less than 0.001.
  \item In \texttt{phase2.r}, \texttt{z\$sd} is calculated using
  \texttt{sqrt(pmax(..., 0))} to avoid the
    extremely rare case of a negative calculated variance.
  \item In \sfn{sienaDataCreate}, handling of structurally determined values
    in \texttt{checkConstraints} corrected (thanks to issue raised by Jos Elkink).
    \end{itemize}

    if all values are missing.
    \end{itemize}
\item Coding:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{siena07internals.cpp} adapted to be compatible with new
   \texttt{clang 16} C++ compiler (thanks to Brian Ripley).
    \end{itemize}
\item Corrections of documentation:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item Help page for \textsf{siena07} corrected with respect to \texttt{x\$lessMem}.
    \end{itemize}

    (these had got lost in some way...).
    \end{itemize}
\item Improvements of functionality:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item  \textsf{sienaGOF} now accepts simulated auxiliary statistics containing missing
        values. If there are any, this will be reported with a warning

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Corrected the check for effects in  \texttt{initializeFRAN.r}

\end{itemize}


\item 2021-12-08 GitHub, package version 1.3.4.

Changes in RSiena:

   \item When an effects object with interaction effects is printed,
     the names of the interacting effects are mentioned,
     and prefixes \texttt{int.} and \texttt{i3.} were dropped.

     immediately when creating the interaction effect instead of waiting
     for its use in \textsf{siena07}.
   \item For function \sfn{sienaGroupCreate} some changes were made:
     if it is applied to a list of length 1, attributes of the single group
     are not recomputed;
     if it is applied to a list of length larger than 1, the attributes
     \texttt{range} and \texttt{range2} of behavioral variables of
     individual groups are
     computed as the range of the unions of the ranges of all the groups.
     The same is done for covariates.
   \item \sfn{print.sienaGroup} slightly extended.
   \item Creation of covariates gives a warning (optional) if all values
     are missing, and also if all non-missing values are the same.
    \end{itemize}
\item Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Some bug corrections referring to the use of
     \textsf{sienaBayes}, which will be integrated later with \rs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item 2021-10-08 GitHub, package version 1.3.3.

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item New effects:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item internal effect parameter for diffusion rate effects (`at least p').
   \item New effect \texttt{outOutAvIntn}.
   \item \texttt{outOutActIntn} also made available for non-directed explanatory networks
     and for two-mode dependent networks.
    \end{itemize}
\item Improvements of functionality:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{toggleProbabilities} added to output of \sfn{sienaRI}.
   \item Trial values of \texttt{theta} used during Phase 2 of \textsf{siena07} added
     to the object \texttt{ans} produced by
     \texttt{sienaFit}  as \texttt{ans\$thetas}.
   \item warnings if a data object contains only missings, or only the same value.
    \end{itemize}
\item Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item if a data set contains a constant covariate, the \texttt{simX} effect will not
     run into an error any more; this is obtained by defining the \texttt{range}
     attribute of the constant covariate as 1 to prevent division by zero,
     and the \texttt{simMean} attribute as 0 instead of \texttt{NaN}
     (\textsf{sienaDataCreate}).
     This is relevant especially for \texttt{sienaGroup} data sets, where covariates
     might be constant for some of the groups.
    \end{itemize}
\item Corrections of documentation:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item In \texttt{sienaAlgorithmCreate},
   the default values of \texttt{diagonalize} for MoM
     is 0.2; this was corrected in the help file.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\item 2021-07-29 GitHub, package version 1.3.2.

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item New effects: \texttt{crprodInActIntn} (thanks to Nynke Niezink),
    \texttt{XXW}.
\item Improvements of functionality:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \sfn{updateTheta} also accepts \texttt{sienaBayesFit} objects
     as \texttt{prevAns}.
   \item Effects of type \texttt{creation} or \texttt{endow} represented in the output of
   \textsf{siena.table} by \texttt{creation} and \texttt{maintenance}, respectively.
    \end{itemize}
\item Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item If \texttt{upOnly} or \texttt{downOnly},
     the \texttt{(out)degree (density)} effect is also excluded
     for symmetric networks
     (this was reported by \textsf{print01Report}, but not carried out).
   \item Message corrected in \textsf{sienaDataCreate} if there is an attribute
   \texttt{higher}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\item 2021-07-13  R-Forge, \sfn{RSienaTest} version 1.2-30.

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsf{sienaBayes}: adaptation of \texttt{nwarm} and \texttt{nmain}
     at the end of \texttt{initializeBayes} dropped.
\end{itemize}

\item 2021-05-02 CRAN/GitHub, package version 1.3.0.
\medskip

The cumulative importance of all changes in the past two years
(including Generalized Method of Moments and continuous
behavioral variables) justifies that the version number
now proceeds from 1.2.x to 1.3.0.

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item Drop \texttt{testthat} in \sfn{tests}.
\end{itemize}


\item 2021-04-30 GitHub, package version 1.2.34.

    \texttt{totInSim, avInSimPopAlt, totInSimPopAlt, constant,
     avAttHigher, avAttLower, totAttHigher, totAttLower}.
\item Changed effects: endowment and creation types for \texttt{avInSim}
     (brought in line with these types for \texttt{avSim}).
\item Improvements of functionality:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \sfn{funnelPlot} adapted to lists of \sfn{sienaFit} objects
     containing some missing estimates or standard errors.
   \item \sfn{plot.sienaGOF}: new parameter \texttt{position}.
   \item Small improvements (constant length of effect names) in
     \sfn{meta.table} and \textsf{siena.table}.
    \end{itemize}
\item Bug corrections:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Restore backward compatibility with respect to checks of \texttt{x\$gmm}.
   \item Correct names reported for tested effects (avoid wrong names being given
     if there are interactions without main effects).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\item 2021-04-14  R-Forge, \sfn{RSienaTest} version 1.2-29.

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:

    (and followed by the warming phase) if no proposals were accepted
    during two batches of iterations.
\end{itemize}

\item 2021-03-19  GitHub, package version 1.2.33.

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{configure.ac} changed (thanks to  Alvaro Uzaheta).
	This gives wider possibilities for installation at a variety of platforms.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item 2021-03-16  GitHub, package version 1.2.32.

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Generalized Method of Moments implemented (Viviana Amati):
     see\\
     \url{https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena/blob/main/docs/manual/Changes_RSiena_GMoM.pdf};
     new function \sfn{includeGMoMStatistics}, extended functionality of \textsf{siena07}.
   \item \sfn{effectsDocumentation} now also includes \texttt{gmm} effects (at the bottom).
   \item \sfn{dyadicCov} made to accept also changing dyadic covariates.
   \item new arguments \texttt{plotAboveThreshold} and \texttt{verbose} for \sfn{funnelPlot}.
   \item Resolved issue with continuous dependent behavior variables
     (Nynke Niezink).
   \item New effects: \texttt{homXTransRecTrip}, \texttt{toU}.
   \item This implied creation of a new effect class \sfn{dyadANetNetObjective}.
   \item \texttt{sqrt} versions for parameter 2 for the effects
      \texttt{to}, \texttt{toBack}, \texttt{toRecip},
     \texttt{from}, \texttt{fromMutual}.
   \item Reinstated effect \texttt{MixedInXW}, also with \texttt{sqrt} version for parameter 2.
   \item Dropped effect \texttt{to.2} (identical to `\texttt{to}')
     and \texttt{MixedInWX} (identical to `\texttt{toBack}').
   \item Description of \texttt{toBack} and \texttt{toRecip} in manual.
   \item Correction in \texttt{phase3.2} of a bug that sometimes led to an error message
     if \texttt{simOnly}.
   \item Display of deviations from targets changed to after subtraction of targets.
   \item Stop if no parameters are estimated and \texttt{simOnly} is FALSE.
   \item Vignette dropped; it is available on the website.
   \item Require \texttt{R >= 3.5.0}.
   \item \sfn{xtable} added to \texttt{Imports} (used to be in \texttt{Suggests}).
\end{itemize}


\item 2020-12-10  GitHub, package version 1.2.29.\\
Integration of GitHub and what was earlier at R-Forge.

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New effects (due to Christoph Stadtfeld):
     \texttt{transtrip.FR, transtrip.FE, transtrip.EE, WWX.EE, WWX.FR, WXX.FE,
     WXX.ER, XWX.ER, XWX.FE, to.2, toBack, toRecip}.
   \item New functions \sfn{meta.table} and \sfn{funnelPlot}.
   \item In \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}, use the definitions for \texttt{projname = NULL}
     also if any environment variable \texttt{\_R\_CHECK*} is set.
   \item Adapted filter \texttt{disjoint} so that it operates correctly
     also when the network is symmetric.\\
     Consequence: constraint that two networks are disjoint
     operates correctly also when one of the networks is symmetric
     and the other is not.
   \item Adapted filter \texttt{higher} so that it operates correctly
     also when the other network is symmetric.\\
     Consequence: constraint that one network is at least as high
     as another network operates correctly also when
     the higher networks is symmetric and the other is not.
   \item In \sfn{CheckConstraints}, used in \textsf{sienaDataCreate}, the requirement
     was dropped that the two networks have the same symmetry property;
     and for \texttt{higher} it is required that if the lower network
     is symmetric, the higher network is also symmetric.
   \item In \sfn{sienaDataConstraint}, if type is \texttt{disjoint} or \texttt{atLeastOne},
     the constraint is also implemented for the pair \texttt{(net2, net1)}.
   \item New parameter \texttt{tested} in \textsf{sienaGOF}.
\end{itemize}

\item 2020-09-16 R-Forge Revision 350, package version 1.2-27.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{tcltk} no longer a requirement; if not available,
        batch mode is followed for \textsf{siena07} (with help
        by James Hollway).
   \item New effect \texttt{transTripX}.
   \item For effect \texttt{from.w.ind}, option \texttt{parameter = -1} added.
   \item The \texttt{to} effect is an ego effect.
   \item For \textsf{siena.table}, some of the \texttt{effectNames} changed to nice strings,
     so that \LaTeX\ can run without errors
     on the table produced if \texttt{type = "tex"}.
   \item The \sfn{sienaMeta} object produced by \textsf{siena08} now has IWLS estimates more easily
     accessible, as \texttt{object\$muhat} and \texttt{object\$se.muhat}.
   \item Error message in \textsf{sienaTimeTest} for \sfn{sienaFit} objects produced with
     \texttt{lessMem=TRUE}.
   \item More extensive error message for error in named vectors in algorithm object
     (\texttt{checkNames} in \sfn{initializeFRAN}).
   \item For \textsf{sienaDataCreate}: more extensive error message, and \texttt{class(...)} replaced
     by \texttt{class(...)[1]}.
   \item multiplication factor \texttt{mult}
     added to \sfn{print.sienaAlgorithm} if \texttt{maxlike}.
   \item \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}: requirements for \texttt{mult} corrected in help page.
\end{itemize}

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vignette \texttt{basicRSiena} added (was earlier available as a script);
     thanks to James Hollway.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Improved initialisation in \textsf{sienaBayes}: initial scale factors (squared)
     and initial parameter estimate (`Kelley').
   \item Allow parameter \texttt{targetMHProb} of \textsf{sienaBayes} to have length 2,
        applying separately to the random parameters and the fixed parameters.
   \item Test on \texttt{class()==} replaced by \texttt{inherits} in \textsf{sienaBayes}.
   \item Another attempt to discard the objects \texttt{zn} and \texttt{zsmall} remaining after operation
     of \textsf{sienaBayes}.
\end{itemize}




\item 2020-04-08 R-Forge Revision 348, package version 1.2-25.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Correction of \textsf{sienaDataCreate} for actor covariates (gave a warning).
 \item Auxiliary function \sfn{dyadicCov} for \textsf{sienaGOF} now can handle missings,
     does not return a named value for frequency of zeros,
     and returns the frequencies without any division.
     The help page indicates how this function can be used to check fit
     for ego-alter combinations of monadic variables.
 \item \sfn{descriptives.sienaGOF} also shows the exceedance probabilities
     of the observed statistics.
 \item The \texttt{NULL} default values for \texttt{modelType}
     and \texttt{behModelType} are implemented already at the \texttt{R}
     side instead of waiting until the information comes to \texttt{C++}.
 \item Some extra information in help page for \textsf{siena07}.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Error corrected that occurred in \textsf{sienaBayes}, \sfn{extract.sienaBayes},
 and \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans} for data with multiple periods.
\end{itemize}


\item 2020-02-16 R-Forge Revision 347, package version 1.2-24.

\item Correction of error in \texttt{modelType} when one-mode as well as two-mode
     networks are used.
\item Added \texttt{startingDate} in \textsf{siena08} to the object produced.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Corrected \textsf{siena.table} for \sfn{sienaBayesFit} objects;
     added \texttt{startingDate} in \textsf{sienaBayes} to the object produced.
\end{itemize}


\item 2020-01-12 CRAN Siena version 1.2-23.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Changed extension names of output files from \texttt{.out} to
    \texttt{.txt}.
\item Option \texttt{projname = NULL} in \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
     This option is used for all examples in \sfn{RSiena} where \textsf{siena07} is called,
     to restrict file writing for examples to the temporary directory.
\end{itemize}



\item 2020-01-16 R-Forge Revision 345, package version 1.2-22.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tested effects reported in print of \sfn{Multipar.RSiena} and
        \sfn{score.Test}.
\item Reordered effects object so that \texttt{reciAct} comes after instead of
     before \texttt{inAct} and \texttt{inAct.c}.
\end{itemize}


\item 2019-12-15 R-Forge Revision 344, package version 1.2-19.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item New effects \texttt{avGroupEgoX}, \texttt{outIso}.
 \item Starting date of estimation reported in
     \texttt{siena.table(..., type = "tex", ...)}.
\item Handling of missings in changing covariates corrected (?).
\end{itemize}

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Changes of \textsf{RSienaTest} version 1.2-18 (see below)
      ported to RSiena.
      The main changes are the introduction of the option of
      continuous dependent behavior variables
      and allowing  \texttt{imputationValues} also in \textsf{sienaDependent}
      (both by Nynke Niezink).
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item In \textsf{sienaBayes}: more precise check that
     \texttt{prevAns} has same specification as \texttt{effects}.
     \texttt{priorSigEta} added to \texttt{sienaBayesFit} object.
	  \texttt{dimnames(ThinParameters)[[3]]} defined as effect names;
     ridge for prior variance of rate parameters if \texttt{priorRatesFromData=1}
     or 2  decreased from 0.5 to 0.01.
 \item \textsf{sienaBayes}: \texttt{zm} and \texttt{zsmall} are removed at the end.
 \item \sfn{plotPostMeansMDS} also shows a title, and coordinates show the dimensions
     of the MDS solution.
 \item The value returned by \sfn{plotPostMeansMDS} contains not only the
     plot coordinates, but also the similarities (correlations)
     between the groups.
 \item \sfn{glueBayes}: added \texttt{z\$varyingInEstimated, z\$varyingNonRateInEstimated,
     z\$ratesInVarying} to the object produced.
     (Else \sfn{extract.sienaBayes} is not going to work properly.)
 \item \sfn{glueBayes}: if one of the sampling parameters is different,
     give a warning instead of a stop.
 \item Corrected error in names of array returned by \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans}.
 \item New parameter \texttt{excludeRates} in \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans, plotPostMeansMDS}.
 \item Use parameter \texttt{pmonly} also in \sfn{plotPostMeansMDS}.
\end{itemize}

\item 2019-10-16 R-Forge Revision 341, \textsf{RSienaTest} version 1.2-18.

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Continuous dependent behavior variables implemented (Nynke Niezink).
     This implies new effect types \texttt{continuousFeedback},
     \texttt{ continuousIntercept}, \\
     \texttt{continuousOneModeObjective},
     \texttt{ continuousRate}, \texttt{ continuousWiener}, \\
     \texttt{ unspecifiedContinuousInteraction}.
   \item \texttt{imputationValues} allowed in \textsf{sienaDependent} (Nynke Niezink).
   \item New effect \texttt{outMore}.
   \item component \texttt{startingDate} added to \sfn{sienaFit} object;
   this date is reported in  \sfn{siena.table(..., type = "tex", ...)}.
   \item Object names are given in \sfn{sienaFit.print} if \texttt{simOnly}.
   \item Speeded up calculation of \sfn{IndegreeDistribution} and \sfn{OutdegreeDistribution}
     for \textsf{sienaGOF} if there are no missings or structurals.
   \item \texttt{regrCoef} and \texttt{regrCor} added to the \sfn{sienaFit} object
   also when not \texttt{dolby}.
   \item Immediate stop if \texttt{useCluster} and \texttt{returnChains}
     both are used (in this case, no chains would be returned anyway).
   \item \textsf{sienaDataCreate}: more informative message in case of constraints.
   \item Small improvements in many help pages.
   \item Corrected error in names of array returned by \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans}.
   \item New parameter \texttt{excludeRates} in \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans},
       \sfn{plotPostMeansMDS}.
   \item Use parameter \texttt{pmonly} also in \sfn{plotPostMeansMDS}.
\end{itemize}


\item 2019-05-20 R-Forge Revision 340, package version 1.2-17.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New effects \texttt{outAct.c}, \texttt{inAct.c}, \texttt{outPop.c}, \texttt{inPop.c}, \texttt{degPlus.c}.
       These are centered versions, which might have better convergence properties
       than their namesakes without the \texttt{.c}.
   \item Effects \texttt{antiInIso} and \texttt{antiInIso2} implemented also for non-directed networks.
   \item Effects \texttt{outTrunc}, \texttt{outTrunc2}, \texttt{outSqInv}, \texttt{isolateNet}, and \texttt{degPlus} got
     endowment effects.
   \item For \texttt{inPopIntn}, \texttt{outPopIntn}, \texttt{inActIntn}, and \texttt{outActIntn}, added `centered'
     to the statistic name.
   \item \sfn{plot.sienaGOF} has a new parameter \texttt{fontsize}; the dots \texttt{...} will also accept parameters
     \texttt{cex}, \texttt{cex.main}, \texttt{cex.lab}, \texttt{cex.axis}, as used more generally
     for plotting in R.
   \item In case of simulation as indicated by \texttt{x\$simOnly~ = ~TRUE},
     the object produced by \textsf{siena07} now also contains the standard errors of the mean,
     called \texttt{estMeans.sem} (see the help page for \textsf{siena07}).
   \item On various places diagnostic output messages were relabeled to `message' or `warning', which implies
   that they can be turned off by commands such as \texttt{suppressMessages}
   or \texttt{suppressWarnings}.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item In \textsf{sienaBayes}: \\
     \texttt{prevAns} now is allowed to have a different specification of
     random effects than \texttt{effects};\\
     it is not allowed to use \texttt{prevAns} and \texttt{prevBayes}
      objects simultaneously;\\
      some further small algorithm changes (see CHANGELOG).
\end{itemize}

\item 2019-02-26 R-Forge Revision 339, package version 1.2-16.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New effects \texttt{maxAAlt, minXAlt} (thanks to Per Block, Marion Hoffman,
     Isabel Raabe, and Kieran Mepham), \texttt{outIsolate}.
    \item Effect name of \texttt{isolate} effect (not its \texttt{shortName})
      changed to \texttt{in-isolate}.
   \item New parameter \texttt{thetaValues} in \textsf{siena07},
     allowing simulations in Phase 3
     with varying parameters according to matrix input.
     Corresponding changes in \sfn{print.sienaFit}.
   \item \sfn{sienaRI}: earlier check for bipartite dependent variables; if so, stop.
   \item Argument \texttt{verbose} added to \sfn{includeEffects} and \textsf{setEffect}.
     (It existed already for \sfn{includeInteraction}.)
  \item \sfn{Wald.RSiena}, \sfn{Multipar.RSiena} and \sfn{score.Test} also produce one-sided
     test statistic if \texttt{df = 1}.
   \item objects produced by \sfn{Wald.RSiena},\sfn{ Multipar.RSiena} and \sfn{score.Test}
     have class \sfn{sienaTest}. These now also have a \textsf{print} method.

\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Allow arbitrary number of interactions in \textsf{sienaBayes}
        (via \textsf{getEffects}).
   \item \sfn{simpleBayesTest} and \sfn{multipleBayesTest} corrected; they were wrong
     for models with user-defined interactions.
   \item \sfn{glueBayes} extended (to allow good use for models with fixed parameters)
     and check for prior rates relaxed (to allow \texttt{priorRatesFromData=2}
     leading to different prior rates.)

   \item New default \texttt{prevBayes\$nwarm >= 1} for
        \texttt{newProposalFromPrev} in \textsf{sienaBayes}.
   \item \textsf{siena.table} for \textsf{sienaBayes} results extended with between-groups s.d.
   \item Argument \texttt{verbose} added to \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans}.
   \item \textsf{sienaBayes}: check that \texttt{prevAns} is a \sfn{sienaFit} object,
     and not \textsf{sienaBayes};\\
     totally skip initial multi-group estimation if \texttt{prevAns} is given \\
     with
     \texttt{((prevAns\$n3 >= 500) \& (!usePrevOnly))}.

\end{itemize}


\item 2019-01-15 R-Forge Revision 338, package version 1.2-15.

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item New effects \texttt{sameXReciAct} and \texttt{diffXReciAct}.
    \item Increased burn-in for ML simulations in \textsf{siena07}.
    \item \textsf{siena.table} adapted for \textsf{sienaBayes} results.
   \item  New functions \sfn{shortBayesResults} and \sfn{plotPostMeansMDS}.
   \item  \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans} works also for an object saved as \texttt{PartialBayesResult}
     (which has \texttt{NA} results for as yet unfinished runs).
   \item  Examples added to help page for \texttt{print.sienaBayesFit}
   (in \texttt{dontrun}...).
\end{itemize}

\item 2018-12-05 R-Forge Revision 337, packages version 1.2-14.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item In the help page of \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}, the possibility is
   mentioned that the multiplication factor (parameter \texttt{mult}) can
   be specified as a vector.
   This allows the possibility for ML estimation to specify the
   multiplication factor separately for periods $\times$ waves.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textsf{sienaBayes}:\\
     the possibility now exists to specify prior variances for non-varying
     parameters, which can be meaningful especially for effects of
     group-level variables;\\
     a new, hopefully better, initial value is used, defined as
     a precision weighted mean of the multi-group MoM estimate and the
     prior mean;\\
     number of subphases for initial global parameter estimation by MoM decreased
     to 2;\\
     prewarming phase introduced before the first \textsf{improveMH};
     checks for dimensions of prior mean and covariance matrix
     put earlier in the initialization phase.
   \item \textsf{extract.sienaBayes} corrected.
\end{itemize}

\item 2018-10-30 R-Forge Revision 336, packages version 1.2-13.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Correct error in \textsf{sienaGroupCreate} for non-centered actor covariates.
   \item Correct error in \textsf{print01Report} that occurred for changing dyadic covariates
     given as lists of sparse matrices.
   \item Also get simulated dependent behavior variables for
     \texttt{siena07(..., returnDeps = TRUE, ...)} for ML estimation (see help page).
   \item \textsf{siena.table} corrected for data sets with several dependent variables.
   \item For \textsf{siena08}: new parameters \texttt{which} and \texttt{useBound}
   in \textsf{plot.sienaMeta};
     new parameter \texttt{reportEstimates}, allowing to reduce
     the output produced.
   \item \textsf{updateSpecification}: also update \texttt{randomEffects} column.
   \item More explanation of sparse matrix input in the help page for \textsf{sienaDependent}.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textsf{sienaBayes}: new parameters \texttt{proposalFromPrev}, which allows
     taking proposal distributions from \texttt{prevBayes} object;\\
     \texttt{incidentalBasicRates} resuscitated;\\
     allow fixed rate parameters, with \texttt{priorRatesFromData = -1};\\
     changed initial values of scale factors for proposal distributions;\\
     new parameters target and \texttt{usePrevOnly};\\
     in case \texttt{prevBayes} is used, parameters \texttt{nrunMHBatches, nSampVarying, nSampConst},
     and \texttt{nSampRates} in the function call of \textsf{sienaBayes} supersede those
     in the \texttt{prevBayes} object;\\
     correct bug for three-effect interactions;\\
     copy parameters \texttt{modelType, behModelType, MaxDegree, Offset, initML},
     from parameter \texttt{algo} to the algorithms created within \textsf{sienaBayes};\\
     more extensive checking of smallest eigenvalue of covariance matrix;\\
     for \texttt{priorRatesFromData = 1} or 2, the resulting prior Covariance
     matrix for \texttt{priorKappa != 1}
     was incorrect; this was corrected;\\
     reported timing changed to elapsed system time.
\end{itemize}

\item 2018-05-13 CRAN, \textsf{RSiena} version 1.2-12.

\item 2018-05-06 R-Forge Revision 335, packages version 1.2-11.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New effects \texttt{gwdspFF} and \texttt{gwdspFB}.
   \item Effects \texttt{simEgoInDist2} and \texttt{simEgoInDist2W}
   for two-mode networks were corrected.
     Perhaps \texttt{simEgoDist2} and \texttt{simEgoDist2W} were broken
     in a previous version; if so, that was now corrected.
   \item Added \texttt{sqrt} version for \texttt{reciAct}, obtained for parameter = 2.
   \item Allowed the value \texttt{parameter = NULL} for \textsf{setEffect} and
   \textsf{includeInteraction},
     meaning that no change is made for the internal effect parameter.
     For \textsf{setEffect} this is the new default,
     implying that when starting the
     default values from \texttt{allEffects.csv} are used, just like in
     \textsf{includeEffects}
     (where no parameter can be given).
   \item New auxiliary functions for \textsf{sienaGOF}:
   \textsf{Triad Census} and \textsf{mixedTriadCensus}
     (contribution by Christoph Stadtfeld).
   \item triad census from \texttt{igraph} added to help page of
   \textsf{sienaGOF-auxiliary}.
   \item improved \textsf{sienatable} output for \texttt{type = "html"}:
   added \texttt{rules = none, frame = void} to
     general options; changed minus to \texttt{\&ndash;}~;
     added column for asterisks to have better alignment for estimates.
   \item Stop cluster also for a user interrupt in  \textsf{siena07}.
   \item Extension of help page for \textsf{siena07} by
   mentioning functions for accessing simulated networks for ML.
\end{itemize}

Change in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textsf{extract.sienaBayes}:
   error corrected that occurred if called with
     \texttt{extracted = "all"} but there are no varying,
     or no non-varying parameters.
\end{itemize}

\item 2018-03-24 R-Forge Revision 334, packages version 1.2-10.

Change in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Example in help file \textsf{siena07} for accessing generated networks
   in case of ML estimation/simulation.
   \end{itemize}

\item 2018-03-21 R-Forge Revision 332, packages version 1.2-9.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Added effects \texttt{avExposure, totExposure, infectDeg,
     susceptAvCovar, infectCovar} for symmetric networks, in
     new effect group \texttt{covarBehaviorSymmetricRate}.
   \item New effects \texttt{degAbsDiffX, degPosDiffX, degNegDiffX, degAbsContrX,
     degPosContrX, degNegContrX}.
   \item Effects \texttt{XWX, XWX1}, and \texttt{XWX2} enabled for
   bipartite networks, in
    new effect group \texttt{dyadBipartiteObjective}.
   \item Added parameter = 2 for \texttt{FFDeg, BBDeg, FBDeg, FRDeg, BRDeg}.
   \item Corrected \texttt{altInDist2, totInDist2} for two-mode networks.
   \item Dropped some duplications in \sfn{effectsDocumentation}.
   \item Modification of effect \texttt{outTrunc2}.
     Perhaps this was superfluous.
   \item Export of last simulated state from ML simulations if
     \texttt{returnDeps}.
   \item Added endowment and creation effects for \texttt{maxAlt} and \texttt{minAlt}.
   \item Error messages for non-character \texttt{nodeSets} in functions
    \sfn{sienaDependent, coCovar,\\ varCovar}.
   \item Improved way of handling missings for distance-2 network effects.
   \item Added components \texttt{requestedEffects}, \texttt{theta}, and
    \texttt{se} to \texttt{siena08}
     (\texttt{theta} and \texttt{se} are the ML estimates).
   \item Error in summary of \sfn{sienaMeta} object corrected:
     for the estimated mean parameter the two-sided $p$ was announced but a
     one-sided $p$ was given. Also the ML results under normality assumptions
     were copied from \sfn{print.sienaMeta} to \sfn{print.summary.sienaMeta}.
   \item For non-directed networks, the initial model now contains
    only basic rates and degree effect.
   \item Added reference to \texttt{DESCRIPTION} and citation info in
    \texttt{{\textbackslash}inst},
   so \texttt{citation("RSiena")} now gives useful information.
   \item The dropping of the exclusion of effects if the variance of a
     covariate is 0, or a covariate has only two values, of version 1.1-306,
     was  taken further (was incomplete).
   \item Message if attributes \texttt{higher, disjoint},
   or \texttt{atLeastOne} are \texttt{TRUE} at the end of \\
     \textsf{sienaDataCreate}.
   \end{itemize}
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item new function \sfn{extract.posteriorMeans} for \textsf{sienaBayes} results.
   \item Restrict check in \textsf{sienaBayes} of maximum
     estimated parameter value after initialization to non-fixed effects.
   \item Correct construction of groupwise effects object in \textsf{sienaBayes}
    so that this
     will work also when evaluation effects for density and/or reciprocity are
     not included; and when there are interaction effects for which the main
     effects are not included.
   \item Corrections for \textsf{print} and \textsf{summary} of \textsf{sienaBayes} objects.
     In \sfn{print.sienaBayesFit}, include fixed parameters and
     give credibility intervals for rate parameters; include variance parameters;
     allow shorter \texttt{ThinParameters};
     print objects returned through \\
     \texttt{partialBayesResult.RData}
     (by adding \texttt{na.rm = TRUE} to quantile).
   \item \sfn{multipleBayesTest} corrected (there was an error for testing
      2 or more linear combinations simultaneously)
       and adapted for cases with fixed  parameters;
     adapted help file text.
   \item All remaining parts of \sfn{rsiena01gui} removed.
   \item As a compensation of this, \sfn{sienaDataCreateFromSession} exported,
   and a more informative help page written.
\end{itemize}

\item 2017-09-09 R-Forge Revision 318, packages version 1.2-4.
Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Longer Description field in \texttt{DESCRIPTION}, as per CRAN suggestions.
   \item Correction of \sfn{print.sienaFit}, repairing the option
        \texttt{include = FALSE}  in \textsf{setEffect} and \\
        \sfn{includeEffects}.
\end{itemize}
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Extra line in example for \texttt{sienaBayes.Rd}.
\end{itemize}

\item 2017-09-08 R-Forge Revision 316, CRAN package version 1.2-3.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item totAlt also for non-directed networks.
 \item Further corrections to make\textsf{RSiena}acceptable for CRAN.
\end{itemize}

\item 2017-09-04 R-Forge Revision 312.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Score test and \textsf{sienaGOF} corrected for the case that some parameters
      are fixed and not tested.
 \item New function \sfn{score.Test}. This allows, for a \sfn{sienaFit}
     object in which some effects were tested with \texttt{test = TRUE}, to get the
     results of the score-type test for some or all of the parameters tested.
     When some effects are tested with \texttt{test = TRUE}, the
     results of the score test are also presented when printing the estimation
     result.
 \item Argument \texttt{varName} added to \sfn{updateTheta}.
     This allows the update to be restricted to one or more of the
     dependent variables.
 \item Operation of option `\texttt{absorb}' (\texttt{behModelType} = 2) corrected.
 \item In \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}, for parameters
     \texttt{Offset, MaxDegree, modelType},
     and \texttt{behModelType}, require that these are named vectors with the names
     of the dependent variables, or NULL; this is checked in \sfn{initializeFRAN}.\\
     The use of non-named vectors for these, in the case of using multiple processes
     may have led to errors in earlier versions.\\
     Note that the default for \texttt{MaxDegree} now is not \texttt{MaxDegree = 0}
     but \texttt{MaxDegree = NULL}.
 \item New effects \texttt{sameXInPopIntn, sameXOutPopIntn, sameXInActIntn,
     sameXOutActIntn}.
 \item For \texttt{networkModelType} 3 (Initiative, \texttt{AAGREE}),
     an offset is added to the
     confirmation model; this is taken from \texttt{Offset} in the algorithm object.
 \item For effects \texttt{inPopX, outPopX, inActX, outActX, sameXInPop, sameXOutAct,
     diffXInPop, diffXOutAct, homXInPop, homXOutAct, altXOutAct, diffXOutAct},
     changed \texttt{interaction2} to \texttt{'} (was \texttt{`1'}, erroneously)
     and default parameter to 1 (\sfn{AllEffects.csv}).
 \item Additional parameter \texttt{dropRates} in \sfn{print.sienaEffects}
    (useful for \textsf{sienaBayes} with many groups).
 \item In \sfn{print.sienaEffects}, omit last remark about random effects if only
     one line is printed.
 \item Corrected use of \texttt{modeltype} (\sfn{initializeFRAN.r, CInterface.r}),
 \item Change in \sfn{print.sienaAlgorithm} for \texttt{modelType}.
 \item Added an example for multiple processes in \sfn{sienaGOF.Rd}, and
      took out verbose reporting from \textsf{sienaGOF} in case of multiple processes.
\end{itemize}
Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
 \item New parameter \texttt{OffSet} in \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
 \item Registration of native routines (requirement for CRAN).
\end{itemize}
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Parameter \texttt{UniversalOffset} of \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}
       renamed to \texttt{Offset}.
 \item Added posterior variances to \sfn{print.sienaBayesFit}.
 \item Correction of error in \textsf{sienaBayes} that could lead to errors
       in results of estimations with data sets for multiple dependent
       variables (networks and/or behavior) with model specifications that
       contain an interaction effect for a dependent variable that is not
       the last of the dependent variables.
 \item Various changes in \textsf{sienaBayes} for less memory use and
       avoiding crashes in some situations.
\end{itemize}

\item 2017-05-08 Revision 306.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New function \sfn{updateSpecification} to includes in an
   effects object a set of effects that are included in another effects object.
   \item New effects \texttt{inPopX, outPopX, inActX, outActX, sameWXClosure, degPlus,\\
     absDiffX, avAltPop, totAltPop, egoPlusAltX, egoPlusAltSqX,
     egoRThresholdX, \\ egoLThresholdX, altRThresholdX, altLThresholdX}.
   \item \texttt{outOutAss} dropped for symmetric networks;
   only \texttt{outInAss} remains.
   \item \texttt{egoX} effect has \texttt{interactionType = "ego"}
   also for symmetric networks.
   \item The exclusion of effects if the variance of a covariate is 0,
     or a covariate has only two values, is dropped (these effects have no meaning,
     but their exclusion was a potential nuisance for meta-analyses).
   \item Description of \texttt{gwespFB} and \texttt{gwespBF} corrected.
   \item \sfn{includeInteraction} has an additional parameter \texttt{random}.
   \item \textsf{siena08} now also accepts a list for ...
   \item Argument \texttt{behModelType} added to \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
       For \texttt{behModelType = 2}, the `absorbing option' is chosen
     in the model for behavioral dependent variables;
     see Section~\ref{S_modeltype_beh} of this manual.
   \item Indication of effect parameters dropped in names for
     \texttt{altInDist2} and \texttt{totInDist2} (they have no effect parameters).
   \item \texttt{ModelType} now is specific to the dependent variable:
     given as a named integer vector in \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}.
   \item \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate,\textsf{siena07}}: new option \texttt{lessMem},
      reducing storage in \textsf{siena07} by leaving out
      \texttt{z\$ssc} and \texttt{z\$sf2} from the object produced;
      but these are used by
     \textsf{sienaTimeTest} and \textsf{sienaGOF}, so running those functions will be impossible
     for \sfn{sienaFit} object obtained with \texttt{lessMem = TRUE}.
   \item extended information in \sfn{print.sienaAlgorithm}.
   \item Modified check for singular covariance matrix after Phase 3.
   \item Warning if \sfn{includeEffects} is used with parameter \texttt{random}.
   \item Warning for impossible or zero changes if maximum likelihood
     (see Section ~\ref{S_ML}, and News page of Siena website).
   \item Some parts dropped from the object produced by \textsf{siena07}
     to reduce memory use.
\end{itemize}
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item sienaBayes:
        various changes to save memory (thanks to Ruth Ripley);
        improved reporting of groups with no changes;
        warning for impossible changes, see Section~\ref{S_sBData};
        if \texttt{priorRatesFromData = 2}, change to different robust covariance matrix
          estimator when this is necessary (i.e., for small number of groups);
        in \sfn{print.summary}, also report \texttt{nImproveMH};
        a few lines added to help file.
   \item \sfn{print.sienaEffects} gives dimensions of \texttt{priorMu}
     and \texttt{priorSigma} if \texttt{includeRandoms}.
\end{itemize}

     covNetNetIn, \\
     homCovNetNetIn, contrastCovNetNetIn, inPopIntnX, inActIntnX, outPopIntnX, \\
     outActIntnX}.
   \item Changes permitting the 4-cycles effects for larger and denser networks.

     row names given to matrices that have rows corresponding to effects;
     adapted so that it runs for models with only 1 parameter;
     adapted so that for a bipartite dependent variable it does not crash.
   \item Warning if \sfn{includeEffects} is used with parameter \texttt{parameter}.
   \item Small additions to \sfn{print.sienaAlgorithm}.
   \item Clearer output for \texttt{MaxDegree} in \sfn{print.sienaFit}.

     (\texttt{initializeFRAN.r}) (this was erroneously not allowed).
   \item New effects \texttt{Jin, Jout, JinMix, JoutMix, altXOutAct,
     doubleInPop, doubleOutAct}.
   \item \sfn{print01Report} now reports in-degrees also for two-mode networks.

     omitted for effects with fixed parameters.
\end{itemize}

Changes in RSiena:

\item 2015-05-20 Revision 285.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{tmax} added to \sfn{sienaFit} objects and
     \texttt{tconv.max} mentioned in \sfn{print.sienaFit}.
   \item \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate} has new arguments \texttt{n2start},
     \texttt{truncation}, \texttt{doubleAveraging}, \texttt{standardizeVar};
     this leads to various changes in \texttt{phase2.r}.
   \item Diagonalization corrected (matrix transpose) (\texttt{phase2.r}).
   \item When there are missings in constant or changing monadic covariates,
     and \\centered=FALSE for their creation by \sfn{coCovar} or
	 \sfn{varCovar}, the mean will be imputed (used to be 0, which was an error).
	 For changing covariates, this is the global mean.
   \item In \sfn{coCovar} and \sfn{varCovar} there is a new argument \texttt{imputationValues},
     which are used (if given) for imputation of missing values.
	 Like all missings, they are not used for the calculation
	 of the target statistics in the Method of Moments.
   \item New effects: \texttt{outOutActIntn, toDist2, from.w.ind}.
   \item In the target statistic for the \texttt{higher} effect, contributions for
     value(ego)=value(alter) are now set appropriately at 0.5 (was 0).
   \item New effectGroup \sfn{tripleNetworkObjective} (\sfn{allEffects.csv, effects.r})
     (see earlier in this manual for its characteristics).
   \item Decent error message when there are (almost) all NA in the dependent
     behavioural variable (\sfn{effects.r}, function \sfn{getBehaviorStartingVals}).
   \item The centering within effects for similarity variables at distance 2
     now is done by the same similarity means as for the \texttt{simX} effect
	  (\texttt{attr(mydata\$cCovars\$mycov, "simMean")}, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\item 2015-04-02 Revision 284.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New effects: \texttt{simEgoDist2, simEgoInDist2, simEgoDist2W, simEgoInDist2W,\\
         sameXOutAct, diffXInPop, diffXOutAct}. The centering for the similarity
         measure in effects such as simEgoDist2 and simDist2 is not yet clear
         (this affects only the outdegree parameter).
   \item  Relevant for creating new effects:
        New effect groups  \sfn{covarABNetNetObjective},
         \sfn{covarANetNetObjective}, and \sfn{covarBNetNetObjective}.
    	See \sfn{SienaSpec.tex/pdf}, section 4.9: \sfn{covarNetNet}.
   \item Bug corrected that occurred in \textsf{print01Report} for a \sfn{sienaGroup} object
     where the component objects have constant dyadic covariates.
   \item When a statistic is not plotted in \sfn{plot.sienaGOF} because
     its variance is 0, a note about this is printed to the screen.
   \item Minimum and maximum of plotted region in \sfn{plot.sienaGOF}
     is calculated without taking into account non-plotted statistics.
   \item Bug corrected with includeTimeDummy for \texttt{timeDummy} greater than
     or equal to 10 (\sfn{sienaTimeTest.r}).
   \item In case of collinear parameter estimates, standard errors
     are reported as NA.
   \item Arguments \texttt{main} and \texttt{ylab} dropped from
     \sfn{plot.sienaGOF}; they did
     not work, and their functionality now is covered by the ...
     argument (so using \texttt{main} and \texttt{ylab} as arguments now should work).
     (Thanks to David Kavaler.)
\end{itemize}
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textsf{sienaBayes}: correction in initialization of truncation rate parameters
     based on prior; error corrected for sampling constant parameters.
\end{itemize}
Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Parameter \texttt{reduceg} added in \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}
   for use in \textsf{siena07}, like in \textsf{RSienaTest}.
\end{itemize}


\item 2014-12-11 R-Forge Revision 282.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Effects \texttt{cl.XWX} and \texttt{cl2.XWX} corrected (thanks to Christoph Stadtfeld).
   \item \texttt{interactionType} of \texttt{gwesp..} effects was made \texttt{dyadic}.
   \item Some layout changes in warning message in \sfn{siena07}.
   \item New effects \texttt{reciPop, reciAct, in3Plus, maxAlt, minAlt, transTrip1, transTrip2}.
   \item Effect \texttt{antiInIsolate2} got alias \texttt{in2Plus}.
   \item \texttt{inPop} is dyadic effect (except for non-directed networks)
     (it is $\sum_j x_{ij} \{\sum_{h \neq i} x_{hj} + 1\}$).
   \item \texttt{egoX} added as effect for non-directed networks
     (can be important for representing effects of group-level covariates
     in multi-group analyses).
   \item Components \texttt{IActors} and \texttt{expectedI} added to \sfn{sienaRI}
     and \sfn{print.sienaRI}.
   \item The check for \texttt{MaxDegree} when running \sfn{siena07} now works properly also
     for \sfn{sienaGroup} objects.
   \item Manual introduces the term \emph{elementary effects}.
\end{itemize}
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textsf{sienaBayes}: the stop caused by singularity of the precision
     matrix after the multi-group estimation now is circumvented;
	 still a warning is printed to the screen.
  \item \sfn{sienaBayes:} option \texttt{priorRatesFromData} changed to values 0-1-2,
     with 0 = former \texttt{FALSE}, 1 = former \texttt{TRUE}, 2 = robust estimation of prior
     for rate parameters from estimates at the end of initialization phase.
  \item Correction of \sfn{print.summary.sienaBayesFit} for models
     with more than one dependent variable.
\end{itemize}

\item 2014-11-19   R-Forge Revision 280.
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Small changes in help pages for \sfn{sienaGOF} and for \sfn{sienaCompositionChange}.
\item New parameters \texttt{nSampVarying} and \texttt{nSampConst} in \sfn{sienaBayes}.
\end{itemize}

\item 2014-11-13  R-Forge Revision 279.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Effect \texttt{AltsAvAlt} renamed to \texttt{avXAlt}.
   \item Effects object no longer used as argument for \textsf{print01Report}.
   \item A lot of new effects: \texttt{sameXInPop, transRecTrip2, totAlt, avInAlt, totInAlt,
     totRecAlt, totXAlt, avXInAlt, totXInAlt,
	 avAltDist2, totAltDist2, avTAltDist2, totAAltDist2,
	 avXAltDist, totXAltDist2, avTXAltDist2, totAXAltDist2,
	 avInAltDist2, totInAltDist2, avTInAltDist2, totAInAltDist2,
	 avXInAltDist2, totXInAltDist2, avTXInAltDist2, totAXInAltDist2,
     XWX1, XWX2, cl.XWX1, cl.XWX2}.
   \item Endowment and creation effects added for \texttt{gwesp...} effects.
   \item Some meaningless effects for two-mode networks dropped.
   \item For non-invertible covariance matrices at the end of \textsf{siena07},
         give diagnostic for the linear combination that gives trouble.
   \item Correction of \sfn{igraphNetworkExtraction} in the help page
       for \sfn{sienaGOF-auxiliary}
     (the earlier version dropped isolated nodes from simulated networks).
   \item In the help page for \sfn{sienaGOF-auxiliary.Rd},
     the example of constraint is replaced
     by the example of eigenvector centrality (because constraint
	 is undefined for isolated nodes, leading to computational problems).
   \item Set diagonal of observed networks to 0 in \sfn{sparseMatrixExtraction}.
   \item \sfn{sienaRIDynamics} restored, after corrections.
   \item `file" parameter of \sfn{sienaRI} dropped (implied platform dependence).
   \item Section in manual about user-defined interaction effects updated.
   \item Parameter \texttt{showAll} added to \sfn{descriptives.sienaGOF}.
   \item Small correction of \sfn{print.siena} (reporting uponly/downonly).
   \item Some changes in \sfn{print.sienaAlgorithm}.
   \item Check in \sfn{siena07} for incorrect \texttt{MaxDegree} specification.
   \item Correction of printing errors arising when result of score-type test is \texttt{NA}.
   \item \texttt{maxRatio} checked for \texttt{NA} or \texttt{NaN} in \sfn{phase2.r}.
   \item \texttt{Siena\_algorithms4.tex} renamed \texttt{Siena\_algorithms.tex};
         this document now is made available as a pdf file at the \SI website.
   \item Some improvement of error messages for \sfn{sienaTimeTest}.
   \item $p$-value for goodness of fit (\sfn{sienaGOF}) rounded to 3 decimal places.
   \item File \sfn{effects.pdf} dropped from \texttt{{$\backslash$}inst{$\backslash$}doc}
          (it can be created by \sfn{effectsDocumentation}).
\end{itemize}
Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \sfn{sienaBayes}: new parameters \texttt{nImproveMH} and \texttt{priorRatesFromData};
      these give the possibility to truncate initial rate parameters depending on prior.
   \item \sfn{glueBayes} corrected so that it can be applied sequentially.
   \item \sfn{multipleBayesTest} now allows matrix parameter to test
     linear combinations.
   \item Improved \sfn{plot.multipleBayesTest} (to show truncation at 0).
\end{itemize}

\item 2014-07-08  Revision 278.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Added \texttt{s50s} to data set.
   \item Corrected \texttt{se} component of \sfn{sienaFit} objects
     (should be standard error, was its square).
   \item new effects \texttt{totDist2, altInDist2, totInDist2,
     totDist2W, altInDist2W,\\
      totInDist2W}.
   \item Some warnings for calculations of \texttt{z\$regrCor}
   and \texttt{z\$regrCoef} avoided in \sfn{siena07}.
   \item \sfn{print01Report} errors corrected, and slightly improved,
    for descriptives for changing dyadic covariates
    and for upOnly / downOnly cases.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \sfn{sienaBayes}:
    Internally multiplied the data-dependent choice of
     \texttt{priorSigma} for rate parameters by \texttt{priorKappa};
     changed \texttt{z\$nwarm} to 0 if \texttt{prevBayes} is used;
     dropped \texttt{plotit} functionality.
\item  \sfn{sienaBayes}, \sfn{glueBayes}, and
     \sfn{print.sienaBayes}:
      adapted to allow inclusion of interaction effects without the corresponding
     main effects.
\item Added parameter \texttt{nwarm2} to \sfn{glueBayes}.
      Checks of identical prior parameters in this function
      restricted to non-rate parameters.
\end{itemize}


\item 2014-06-22 R-Forge Revision 277.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Higher write-to-screen frequency for batch operation of \sfn{siena07}.
\item Function \sfn{includeEffects} now includes parameters \texttt{fix} and \texttt{test}.
\item Various small bug corrections (see the \sfn{ChangeLog}, 1.1-275).
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes in \sfn{sienaBayes} and its print and summary methods.
\item Corrected starting printing \sfn{sienaBayesFit} at \texttt{nfirst}.
\item New function \sfn{glueBayes} for combining \sfn{sienaBayesFit} objects.
\item Added functions \sfn{simpleBayesTest} and \sfn{multipleBayesTest}.
\end{itemize}

\item 2014-04-26 R-Forge Revision 274.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Correction of effect \texttt{homWXClosure}.
\item Small change in \textsf{print01Report} to improve reporting
     two files of composition change.
\item \sfn{sienaRI}: require that \texttt{file} argument is not NULL for non-Windows
     operating systems.
\end{itemize}

\item 2014-04-13 R-Forge Revisions 267-271.

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Updates to let \sfn{sienaBayes} accept
     a wider range of data and models (e.g., user-defined interactions);
     and various corrections to \sfn{sienaBayes}.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Added function \sfn{sienaRI} for assessment of relative importance of effects,
      with print and plot methods.
\item In \sfn{coDyadCovar} and \sfn{varDyadCovar}, centering now also is
      optional by the new option \texttt{centered} (like it was done for
      \sfn{coCovar} and \sfn{varCovar} in revision 1.1-251).
\item Corrected bug when printing siena object with a symmetric network;
     and in \sfn{varDyadCovar} corrected a bug occurring when calling it
     with a named list.
\item Added standard errors as component \texttt{se} to \texttt{sienaFit}
     objects.
\end{itemize}


\item Internal changes in the code version 1.1-255 to 1.1-267 (see \sfn{ChangeLog}).

\item No noticeable changes from version 1.1-251 to 1.1-254.

\item 2014-02-13 R-Forge Revision 251

It should be noted that two changes were made that potentially
have an influence on some results obtained.

First, the effects \texttt{gwespFF, gwespBB, gwespFB, gwespBF, gwespRR}
were modified in \textsf{RSienaTest} to bring them in accordance with the literature.
This means that the `old' parameter $\alpha'$ was effectively replaced by
$\alpha = -\log\big(1-\exp(\alpha')\big)$; here $\alpha$ is the internal
effect parameter divided by 100. For the default $\alpha = \log(2)$
this means no difference.

Second, in the help page for \sfn{sienaGOF-auxiliary}, geodesic distances
were changed to non-directed. This makes more sense usually and was done to
avoid runtime errors that occurred very rarely.

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item New effects \texttt{cl.XWX}, \texttt{homXTransTrip},
    \texttt{homWXClosure}, and \texttt{sharedPop}.
 \item Effect \texttt{cycle4} extended to non-directed one-mode networks
    (for directed one-mode networks this is \texttt{sharedPop}).
 \item Effect \texttt{jumpXTransTrip} ported to non-directed networks.
 \item \texttt{gwesp..}  effects modified and ported to non-directed networks.
 \item Also take account of behavior user-specified interactions in
     \sfn{includeInteraction} and \textsf{setEffect}.
 \item Correction: Effect \texttt{to} is not a dyadic effect.
 \item Manual: added paragraph about how to import results from
     \sfn{xtable} and \sfn{siena.table} into MS-Word.
 \item \textsf{sienaGOF}: added the name of the \sfn{sienaFit} object
     as attribute \sfn{sienaFitName} to each of the \sfn{sienaGofTest} objects.
 \item Correction in \sfn{sparseNetworkExtraction} to avoid errors occurring
     when the extracted network has no edges.
 \item In the help page for \sfn{sienaGOF-auxiliary}, geodesic distances
     changed to non-directed; which avoids a further error
     when the extracted network has no edges.
 \item Correction of an error in \sfn{print.siena} for data sets including
     other types than \texttt{oneMode}.
 \item Changed bandwidth selector for violin plots in \sfn{plot.sienaGOF} to `nrd",
     to avoid long violins in cases where all simulations have the same outcome.
\end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Further work on \sfn{SienaBayes}.
\end{itemize}

Changes in RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ported effects \texttt{outRateLog} and \texttt{outTrunc2} from \textsf{RSienaTest}.
\end{itemize}

\item 2013-12-04 R-Forge Revision 250

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
\item New option \texttt{centered} in \sfn{coCovar} and \sfn{varCovar}.
\item \sfn{setEffect}, \sfn{updateTheta}, and \sfn{prevAns} in \sfn{siena07}
     now also work properly for user-specified interactions.
\item Tests \sfn{Wald.RSiena} and \sfn{Multipar.RSiena} added.
\item Error occurrence with message about \texttt{cvalue} in
      \sfn{EvaluateTestStatistic} corrected.
\item Divergent parameters in \sfn{siena07} get \texttt{NA} for their rows and columns
     in the resulting covariance matrix.
\end{itemize}
The following changes in revision 244 were ported from \textsf{RSienaTest} to RSiena:
\begin{itemize}
\item In \sfn{siena08}, also report Bonferroni combination
     of the two Fisher combinations.
\item In \sfn{siena07}, rolled back change in truncation from version 1.1-227
     to the earlier procedure.
\item \sfn{descriptives.sienaGOF} added.
\item Minor changes of output in \textsf{siena.table}, \sfn{print.siena},
    \textsf{siena07}, and in error message for \sfn{includeEffects}.
\item Change artificial results from 999 to NA in \sfn{siena07}.
\item For ML estimation: added autocorrelations during phase 3
     to \sfn{print.summary.sienaFit}.
\end{itemize}

\item 2013-10-31 R-Forge Revision 246

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New behavior objective function effects \sfn{avSimAltX}, \sfn{totSimAltX} and
    \sfn{avAltAltX} to differentiate sources of peer influence in directed networks.
   \item Added effect class \sfn{covarBehaviorNetObjective} to \sfn{effectsDocumentation.R}.
   \item Fix of a bug that occurred in the case of on average decreasing behavior variables.
  \end{itemize}

\item 2013-16-09 R-Forge Revision 245

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
\begin{itemize}
   \item New structural rate effect \sfn{outRateLog}.
   \item Duplication of \sfn{outTrunc} effect: \sfn{outTrunc2}, allowing use
    with two different parameters.
   \item In \sfn{siena08}, also report Bonferroni combination
     of the two Fisher combinations.
   \item In phase2 of \sfn{siena07}, rolled back change in truncation
     from version 1.1-227 to the earlier procedure.
   \item Added function \sfn{descriptives.sienaGOF} with numerical results
   of \sfn{plot.sienaGOF}.
   \item Minor changes of output in \sfn{siena.table} and various reports,
    and in error message for \sfn{includeEffects}.
   \item  Change artificial (`missing') results of \sfn{siena07} from 999
    to NA.
   \item Added autocorrelations during phase 3 to \sfn{print.summary.sienaFit}
   for ML estimation.
   \item Start of the manual reorganized and partially rewritten (with help from
     Zs\'{o}fia Boda and Andr\'{a}s V\"{o}r\"{o}s); instructions for
     \sfn{siena01Gui} separated in siena01gui.pdf.
  \end{itemize}

\item 2013-10-09 R-Forge Revision 244

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Repair bug that prevented compilation for Mac.
\end{itemize}

\item 2013-09-17 R-forge revision 243

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Correct bug in \sfn{EffectFactory} for \texttt{isolatePop} effect.
   \item Improved plotting of \textsf{sienaGOF} objects so that observed values
     outside of the range of simulated values don't run off the chart.
   \item Improve treatment of structural values in \textsf{sienaGOF}.
  \end{itemize}
Changes in RSiena:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Add functions \sfn{AntiIsolateEffect.h} and \sfn{AntiIsolateEffect.cpp}
     which were forgotten to include in revision 242.
  \end{itemize}

\item 2013-08-27 R-forge revision 242

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} as well as \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Correction to Dolby option for the case of more than 2 waves:
     in \sfn{phase1.r} and \sfn{phase3.r}, scores are added
     (instead of averaged) over waves.
     (Averaging was wrong, because in phase 2 they are added.)
  \item New effects: \texttt{anti isolates}, \texttt{anti in-isolates},
   and \texttt{anti in-near-isolates}.
  \item Effect \texttt{inIsolatePop} dropped (it was shortlived).
  \item Improved printing of results of \sfn{siena07} in the case
    \sfn{simOnly}.
  \item Prettier response printed to console for \sfn{includeEffects} and
        \sfn{setEffect}.
  \item \sfn{z\$estMeans} added to sienaFit objects \sfn{z}:
     vector of estimated expected values of statistics;
	 this is \sfn{colMeans(z\$sf) + z\$targets}  but if dolby,
	 the regression on the scores is subtracted.
  \end{itemize}


\item 2013-08-23 R-forge revision 241

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} as well as \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Corrected bug (leading to error message)
     that occurred if there was only one option
     for choice of alter. It appeared mainly in cases where all changes
     were upward only (or downward only); in practice, it only was observed
     yet for two-mode networks with upward changes only.
  \item  Drop the unintended multiplication of the target statistic
     for the \texttt{inPop} effect by $n$.
  \item Trapped some execution errors (mainly associated with inversion of
    singular matrices) and allowed the functions to end properly
    with a warning message.
  \item Added various degree-related effects to bipartite networks.
  \item New effect \texttt{inIsolatePop}.
  \end{itemize}

\item 2013-08-08 R-forge revision 240

Changes in \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Added the parameter reduceg to \textsf{siena07}.
  \end{itemize}

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Added effects crprod and inPopIntn for two-mode networks.
  \end{itemize}

\item 2013-06-18 R-forge revision 232

Changes in RSiena:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The possibility to use the obsolete packages \sfn{snow} and
     \sfn{rlecuyer} for R versions older than 2.14.0 was dropped;
     their functionality was replaced by package \sfn{parallel}.
   \item The DESCRIPTION file was corrected to satisfy CRAN requirements.
  \end{itemize}

\item 2013-06-15 R-forge revision 231

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} as well as \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
   Make the `cumulative' option operational in \sfn{BehaviorDistribution}
   for \sfn{sienaGOF}.
  \item
   Correct bug in treatment of missing values in  \sfn{sparseMatrixExtraction}
   for  \sfn{sienaGOF}.
  \item
    Allow sparse observed data matrices, and structural zeros and ones, in
      \sfn{sparseMatrixExtraction} and  \sfn{networkExtraction},
     and bipartite networks in  \sfn{networkExtraction} for  \sfn{sienaGOF}.
  \item
   Report correct centering (by overall means) of individual
     covariates for multi-group objects in  \sfn{print01Report}.
  \item
   If there is a composition change object, MoM estimation is forced
     to be non-conditional. This is reported in the help file
     for  \sfn{sienaCompositionChange}.
  \end{itemize}
\item 2013-05-10 R-forge revision 230

Changes in \textsf{RSiena} as well as \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Check whether the maximum observed degree is not higher than
     \sfn{maxDegree}.
	\item Fix error in implementation of \sfn{maxDegree}.
	\item Fix bug in \sfn{print.siena} and extend \sfn{print.siena}.
	\item Make print method for class \textsf{sienaDependent}.
  \end{itemize}
\item 2013-04-19 R-forge revision 227

  Changes in \textsf{RSiena} as well as \textsf{RSienaTest};
  both now are very similar; \textsf{sienaBayes}, \sfn{algorithms}, and
  \sfn{profileLikelihoods}
  are the only functions in \textsf{RSienaTest} not in RSiena.
  Available effects now are the same in both packages.

  Main changes visible to users:

For Siena only:
  \begin{itemize}
	\item function \sfn{bayes} was removed (still under development in
        \textsf{RSienaTest}).
	\item Attributes \sfn{allowOnly} and \sfn{simOnly} ported from
        \textsf{RSienaTest}.

For\textsf{RSiena}and \textsf{RSienaTest}:
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Changes to \textsf{sienaGOF}: new use structure with extraction functions
		\sfn{sparseMatrixExtraction}, \sfn{networkExtraction},
        \sfn{behaviorExtraction},
		allowing the testing of any dependent variable;
		commented out some superfluous lines.
	\item The function \sfn{sienaModelCreate} is now called
        \sfn{sienaAlgorithmCreate},
		but the earlier name is still retained as an alias;
		the class name of the object created by this function is now called
		\sfn{sienaAlgorithm}.
	\item The function \sfn{sienaNet} is now called \sfn{sienaDependent},
		but the earlier name is still retained as an alias;
		the class name of the object created by this function is now
		\textsf{sienaDependent}.
	\item The function \sfn{effectsDocumentation} now has an extra argument
        \sfn{effects};
		if this points to an effects object, all available effects
		in this effects object are listed with \sfn{shortName},
		with a variety of other often used characteristics.
	\item Added effects (some existed already in \sfn{RSienaTest}):

		average exposure effect on rate xxxxxx, \sfn{avExposure}

		susceptibility to av. exp. by indegree effect on rate xxxxxx,
			\sfn{susceptAvIn}

		total exposure effect on rate xxxxxx, \sfn{totExposure},

		(corresponding to $\alpha = \log(2)$.) See earlier in this manual.
	\item Added to \textsf{siena07} (defined by \textsf{sienaAlgorithmCreate}):
		option \sfn{Dolby} for variance reduction.
		Correlations between scores and statistics are reported in output file;
		this is a measure for the amount of variance reduction.
	\item Added to \textsf{siena07}:
		option \sfn{diagonalize} for having more possibilities for
		tuning the algorithm
		(extent of diagonalization of matrix $D$ in Robbins-Monro update).
	\item \sfn{sienaTimeTest} updated; now also contains effect-wise tests,
		groupwise tests (for group objects), automatic exclusion of
		collinear effects, and has prettier output and improved	summary.
	\item Overall maximum convergence ratio, \sfn{x\$tconv.max}
		(maximum value of $t$-ratio for convergence, for any linear combination)
		added to result of \textsf{siena07}.\\
        This is a very severe convergence criterion, and not meant as a default
        criterion to judge convergence in practical cases.
	\item The \textsf{print}method for objects of class \sfn{siena} (created by
        \textsf{sienaDataCreate})
		has been extended with printing \sfn{uponly} and \sfn{downly} attributes,
		if these are \texttt{TRUE}.
	\item A bug in the starting values for two-mode networks was corrected.
	\item Small bug fixed in \sfn{print01Report} for reporting of \sfn{uponly}
        and \sfn{downonly},
		in the case where this does not affect all periods.
	\item Changed almost all \sfn{.Rd} documentation files: sometimes to make them
		better understandable or complete, sometimes to make more appropriate
		examples, sometimes only minor prettifications.
	\item Updated scripts:\\
		Rscript01DataFormat.R, Rscript02VariableFormat.R,
 	 	Rscript03SienaRunModel.R,\\
 	 	Rscript04SienaBehaviour.R.
		(of RSienaDescriptives only the date was changed.)

  the effects. Problem was introduced in revision 81.
\item 2010-06-10 Updated time heterogeneity script for Tom
\item 2010-06-08 R-forge revision 102: \textsf{RSienaTest} only. Removed
includeTimeDummy.
\item 2010-06-08 R-forge revision 101: \textsf{RSienaTest} only. Fixed RateX so that it
  works with changing actor covariates as well.
\item 2010-06-08 R-forge revision 100: corrected revision numbers in \sfn{ChangeLog}.
\item 2010-06-08 R-forge revision 99

\item 2010-06-08 R-forge revision 98
\begin{itemize}
\item Fix to bug in constant dyadic covariates with missing values.

  treatment of missing values in sparse matrix format networks has been
  corrected further (the change in revision 96 was not quite correct).
